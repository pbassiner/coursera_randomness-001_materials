1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:04,690
I'm going now to illustrate the notion of
deterministic cares, with what

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:08,300
is possible the simplest example, even
simpler than the model of Lorenz.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,050
This example is called the logistic map.

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,660
Its a time evolution by this three steps.

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,210
So instead of having differential
equations, instead

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,830
of having derivatives with respect to
time,

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,890
We just had the relation between what

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,760
happens at the following step as a
function

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,090
of the value of the variable, at the
previous step.

10
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,660
It's a simple quadratic equation with a
parameter mu.

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,650
This model had a initial motivation as a
model for evolution of populations.

12
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:42,550
But nowadays it's not used as such, it's
just used as

13
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,750
the simplest example of a chaotic map with
a rich behavior.

14
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,600
So in order to see what happens with

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,870
these iteration, with this evolution, we
are going

16
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,942
to concentrate on the whole of the
parameter mu.

17
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,740
If mu is small, the behavior is not
chaotic.

18
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,840
It's very regular and very easy to
explain.

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,580
In fact if, for instance if mu is more

20
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:08,640
than 1, any initial population just dies
out with time.

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,550
You see in this graph, three initial
populations, 0.5, 0.3 and 0.1.

22
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,600
And all of them decay down to zero in a
few iterations.

23
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,890
If mu is between one and two, the behavior
is also rather predictable.

24
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,520
Namely any population would converge to a
given value, the same

25
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,180
one for all of them given by mu minus 1
over mu.

26
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,990
Now, if mu is larger than two.

27
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,360
But still below three, something else
happens.

28
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,990
The ultimate behavior or what is called
asymtotic

29
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,050
behavior or the long time behavior, is the
same.

30
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,090
It will stabilize the population, will
stabilize to

31
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,780
the same value mu minus 1 over mu.

32
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,790
But it does it with some oscillations, not
monotonically as we saw before.

33
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,070
Something more dramatic happens if you
cross the boundary of three.

34
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,940
From mu larger than three and smaller than

35
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:09,040
that other particular value, any
population initially at

36
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,404
any value will, will end up oscillating
between two values.

37
00:02:13,404 --> 00:02:16,240
This behavior is called bifurcation.

38
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:22,840
It means that what was previously a unique
equilibrium point,

39
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,990
the mu minus 1 over mu, becomes now a
cycle, an equilibrium cycle.

40
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,840
So there is no equilibrium point but

41
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,100
there's an oscillation, between one point
and another,

42
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,420
and it back to the first and back to the
second, and so on forever.

43
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,740
Here is, I plotted it again on longer
scale.

44
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,880
One of the previous curves, of period 2.

45
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,620
Now let's see what happens when mu
increases again a little bit.

46
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,880
When mu goes around 3.5, the behavior

47
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,130
looks also very oscillatory, but is
different from

48
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,590
the previous one, in that, now the
oscilation

49
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,350
is among four values instead of two
values.

50
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,120
So we say that this is an oscillation of
period 4.

51
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,948
And if mu is only slightly larger, 3.56
now, there is an oscillation

52
00:03:09,948 --> 00:03:15,434
of period 8, an oscillation among eight
possible values and so on.

53
00:03:15,434 --> 00:03:18,542
There will be an oscillation for mu
slightly

54
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:21,892
larger of period 16, 32, 64 and so on.

55
00:03:21,892 --> 00:03:25,447
And if our critical value around 3.66,
there are

56
00:03:25,447 --> 00:03:29,690
just too many points to detect a
meaningful oscillation.

57
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,190
At that point, the system becomes chaotic.

58
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,220
Let's see what happens for mu equals 3.9
just as an example.

59
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,200
Here is a clear example of chaotic
behavior.

60
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,380
You see the three curves corresponding to
three initial conditions.

61
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,140
And these initial conditions are very,
very close to each other.

62
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:51,045
They differ in the fourth digit x1 0.2999,
or

63
00:03:51,045 --> 00:03:57,740
x1, 0.3000, or x1 0.3001.
You see that in the first

64
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:04,180
10 iterations or so, 10 to 15 iterations,
the three curves are very similar.

65
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,260
Suddenly, around the 15th iteration.

66
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,250
The three curves start deviating
significantly from each other.

67
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,170
And at some point there is no relation any
more.

68
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,930
You see here for instance, the blue curve
is almost flat.

69
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:16,150
The other

70
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,440
two are wildly oscillating.
Now, here is the red curve that is flat.

71
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,338
Sometimes it's the green curve of is flat
here and here

72
00:04:23,338 --> 00:04:27,374
and the other oscillate and oscillations
don't correspond to each other.

73
00:04:27,374 --> 00:04:30,190
And now I can come to the former
definition of chaos.

74
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,920
The plot is slightly differnet because I
changed again the mu.

75
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,060
Now its 3.94 this time.

76
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,580
As I said a couple of times before.

77
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,540
Chaos is defined by sensitivity to the
initial

78
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,310
conditions, that is very clearly
demonstrated by these curves.

79
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,450
But another important feature of chaos is
mixing.

80
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,580
Mixing means that each evolution for every

81
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,060
possible initial conditions explores
almost all possible values.

82
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,480
What does it mean?

83
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,190
Suppose that you have another system that
is sensitive to initial

84
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,770
conditions, that is a ball on the top of a
hill.

85
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,510
Of course if you put the ball.

86
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,420
Is light in the right or is light on the
left, the ball will

87
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,090
fall into two different, very different
values.

88
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,600
So it's sensitive to initial conditions.

89
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,720
But the system is not chaotic, because the
long time

90
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,550
behavior is just to be in one valley or
another.

91
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,980
Here, you see that, let's take the red
curve, it

92
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:26,590
takes very high values, very low values,
some intermediate values.

93
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,550
So and, and these continuous all the time.
So that's the idea of mixing.

94
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,510
That all values or almost all

95
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,740
values, are taken at some point by the
evolution.

96
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,510
This makes it hard to predict in the long
run.

97
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,680
As a random number generator, such a
process is not really amazing.

98
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,620
We have just said that its hard to predict
in the long term.

99
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,640
However, it's easy to predict in the short
term.

100
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,440
So one could consider using these
processes on a number generator,

101
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,580
by taking long steps, like from here to
here for instance.

102
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,580
But the problem is that it's not

103
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,660
very efficient.

104
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,740
Because it's many iterations of the map,
in order

105
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,120
to adjust one step of the random number
generator.

106
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,060
In fact as random number generator it is
not particular interesting.

107
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,720
But I have shown it as a clear example of
a chaotic system, and a very simple one.

108
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,950
One single variable.
