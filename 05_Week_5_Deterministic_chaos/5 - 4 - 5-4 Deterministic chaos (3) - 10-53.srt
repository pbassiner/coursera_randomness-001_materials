1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:03,400
I'm pretty convinvced that the best way to
learn about chaos and

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,660
all the systems that exhibit chaos is to
just browse the Internet.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,000
There are amazing websites with beautiful
photos, animations, descriptions.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,940
I will not spend too much time here.

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,490
But before you browse, I just want to
introduce you to

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,750
the broad classes of chaos that has been
de, has been described.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,820
Just to give you some ideas.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,900
And then really please after that browse
the internet and find.

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,040
How many interesting things have been done
in the past 40 years or so?

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,580
First of all, there is a traditional
division of

11
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:41,610
physical systems, dynamical systems, into
closed and open systems.

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,870
The closed systems are called also
"conservative",

13
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,940
no pun intended for politics; or
"Hamiltonian."

14
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,920
The open systems are sometimes called
"dissipative."

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,060
What is a closed system?

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,030
It's a system that is considered as

17
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,220
completely isolated, from the rest of the
universe.

18
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,410
As a consequence, the energy of a closed
system is conserved.

19
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,620
That is why it's called a conservative
system.

20
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,230
During the evolution the energy of the

21
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,280
degrees of freedom under study don't
change.

22
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,350
Of course, the closed systems are a
theoretical idealization.

23
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,060
There is no real closed systems, but If

24
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,480
you think of a typical example that are
planets.

25
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,790
It's true that there is very, very, very
little dust in open space.

26
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:30,840
So you can safely consider that a planet
is not feeling any friction.

27
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,050
The only interaction it feels is

28
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,470
the interaction with the other celestial
bodies.

29
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,720
Other examples are essentially most of you
studied in high school mechanics.

30
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,910
For instances ideal springs,

31
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,270
ideal pendula and so on.

32
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,280
Dissipative system or open systems on the
contrary,

33
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,020
are those that exchange energy with other
systems.

34
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,990
In this case, the evolution goes toward an
attractor.

35
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,650
I'm going to explain what is this in the
next slide.

36
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,170
Many examples, again essentially
everything that

37
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,650
you see around you, interacts with
environment.

38
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,530
But, a very dramatic example, for instance
turbulence.

39
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,820
Double end flow of water for instance.

40
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,692
This is due to the interaction with the
boundaries of the channel

41
00:02:14,692 --> 00:02:18,820
or the sea or the river on which the water
is propagating.

42
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,415
The Lorenz map is dissipative, the
logistic map is also a dissipative one.

43
00:02:24,415 --> 00:02:29,070
It's this trait in time as we said.
Let us start with open system first.

44
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,700
Of course if the open system is pure of
dissipation.

45
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,600
Namely the energy of the system is lost
from

46
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,130
the system to the environment, then the
system stops.

47
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,680
In this case what is called the attractor
is just a point.

48
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,230
Is a point of the mathematician that
describes the state of the system being

49
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,770
stopped.
If there is both dissipation and drive,

50
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:58,310
so the energy of the system gives energy
outside, but also receives energy from

51
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,610
the outer world.

52
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,266
Then there are essentially two kind of
behaviours.

53
00:03:01,266 --> 00:03:05,070
The system may oscillate with one or more
frequencies.

54
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:11,500
In this case the attractor is a cycle, or
the system may become chaotic.

55
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,760
And the attractor become what is called
the strange attractor.

56
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,300
And again, if you go to the internet you
can browse you

57
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:22,394
would find the beautiful strange attractor
of the Lorenz system, and many others.

58
00:03:22,394 --> 00:03:24,070
Now to be chaotic,

59
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,500
just for your information, I'm not going
to give the details now.

60
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,980
An all consistent requires at least three
variables for

61
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,230
continuous time, as we have seen in the
Lorenz model.

62
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,240
However, for this three time, as we seen
with

63
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,890
the logistic map, it can be just one
variable.

64
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,450
An interesting question is, how is
possible that some

65
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,980
trajectories go all of them, to a given
attractor.

66
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,200
To a given set of trajectories that these
ultimately,

67
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,710
they stay there.

68
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,986
While showing sensitivity to initial
conditions.

69
00:03:52,986 --> 00:03:56,320
If all the trajectories end up in the
attractor then,

70
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,701
you may think oh, there is no sensitivity
to initial conditions.

71
00:03:59,701 --> 00:04:02,830
In fact that can be, that there is a
condition for that,

72
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,520
is that the attractor must be what is
called a fractal object.

73
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,760
And I'm going to present some fractals in
the next segment.

74
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,360
Let us now move to closed systems.

75
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,800
And the first example, I want to discuss
is

76
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,420
the famous three body problem.

77
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,540
Is a problem essentially in Astronomy

78
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,770
although you can formulate for other
situations.

79
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,780
In which you don't consider only for
instance the

80
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,970
earth and the sun or the earth and the
moon.

81
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,120
But you consider the three of them, the
sun, the earth, and the moon.

82
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,450
In fact here, instead I will consider an
example that is more specific for chaos.

83
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:40,700
That is, the planet Saturn, one of its
satellites called Mimas.

84
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:46,230
And the famous rings of Saturn,
represented by these three rings.

85
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,870
In fact of course as you know there are
many more.

86
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,680
So, why is it a closed system?

87
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,040
Well, because again there is no dust out
there, so there is only these body there.

88
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,410
There is no interaction with anything
else.

89
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,016
No dissipation, and normal orbital
behaviour.

90
00:05:00,016 --> 00:05:02,810
And we know from Kepler's law, that the

91
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:06,580
period of an orbit depends on the
distance,

92
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,600
as the square of the period be
proportional

93
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,630
to the radius of the orbit to the cube.

94
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:17,020
In fact its not the radius but the,
largest semi axis of the ellipse.

95
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,600
Now, here we are in a situation where I
have this three grains of dust.

96
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,590
And at that particular position at the
given

97
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,820
time, and the, the moon Mimas at that
position.

98
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,170
So what is happening?

99
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,200
Well because of tidal forces,

100
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,380
three grain of dust would be attracted
towards Mimas.

101
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,910
Then time goes by, all these systems

102
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,370
rotate around Saturn, in first
approximation at least.

103
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,520
And at a later time, here is the
situation.

104
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,390
On the, inner orbit, the period is faster,
so it the period is longer.

105
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:55,800
The frequency is faster, so the grain of
dust in the inner orbit has gone further.

106
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,240
In the central orbit,

107
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,580
the grain of dust is back at the same
position.

108
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,920
And in the outer orbit, the grain of dust
is delayed.

109
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,470
And mine must happens to be back in the
same position as before.

110
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,278
So what happens here?

111
00:06:08,278 --> 00:06:12,130
The two, internal and external grain of

112
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:15,452
dust feel a different attraction than
before.

113
00:06:15,452 --> 00:06:16,780
Where as the one in the central

114
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,960
orbit feels exactly the same attraction as
before.

115
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,530
Now you repeat this process many, many
times, and you

116
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,360
realize that the grains of dust in the
central orbit.

117
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,470
Will constantly feel the same kind of
attraction, so this

118
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:33,892
attraction will accumulate over time, so
that orbit becomes unstable.

119
00:06:33,892 --> 00:06:35,750
In fact this orbit is renal, a resonant
2.1.

120
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,600
It means that the grains of dusk in the
orbit,

121
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,840
in the ring, would go twice as fast, as
the moon.

122
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,670
And such a very resonant orbits become
unstable at the tidal forces.

123
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,950
And because of the chaotic motion that is
generated there, the matter is expelled.

124
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,850
And this is the origin of what is called
the Cassini division.

125
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,450
If you look at the rings of Saturn there
are some gaps.

126
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:03,380
And the most obvious gap is that one is
called the Cassini division.

127
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,380
And, it's also in fact this resonant orbit
effect, is also the origin of

128
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,370
some other of the gaps in the Saturn
rings, although not all of them.

129
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,680
Some of them are still not understood.

130
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,340
So, our first example of chaos is
concerned by resonance.

131
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,600
And by the fact that the grains of dust in
the

132
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,530
central orbit are always in the same
relative position with the moon.

133
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,140
They get the same kick all the time in the
same

134
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,940
direction, and at the end of the day they
will get.

135
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,599
Expelled from the stable motion that would
be the orbit.

136
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,410
A second example of closed system.

137
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:39,610
This one is clear, it's a bit, it's, it's
mathematical, but it is a clear image.

138
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,300
It's what is called the billiard.

139
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,620
And this is what is called Sinai's
billiard by

140
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,690
the name of the one, who started it
mathematically.

141
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:50,610
You see this is just the black dots are
just half spheres.

142
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:56,430
And there is a small body, a small ball
you can imagine, that impinges on them.

143
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:59,620
And is reflected without losing any
energy.

144
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,980
So is a conservative system, is just a
pure reflection.

145
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,770
The drawing that I have there illustrates

146
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,460
how Sinai's billiard is sensitive to
initial conditions.

147
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,900
You see two trajectories that are not very
different at the beginning.

148
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,090
They become very rapidly different.

149
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,950
They end up in completely different
positions.

150
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,850
An equivalent way of describing a Sinai's
billiard is just to

151
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,300
concentrate on a single sphere and enclose
it with a box.

152
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,180
So now the particle, there's only one, one
sphere, and

153
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,890
the particle will bounce between the
boundary and the sphere.

154
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,610
What happened there for some trajectories
of

155
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,590
course, very special ones, the motion is
periodic.

156
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,520
If I send the, the small ball
perpendicularly

157
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,080
on the sphere it just bounces back and
forth.

158
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,680
But for most trajectories, you see that
the motion becomes chaotic.

159
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,240
And in fact what happens is that almost
all trajectories end up filling the space.

160
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,090
At some point in time, you can find the
moving ball

161
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,770
at any position you want.

162
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,350
This property is called ergodicity in the
language of physicists.

163
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,890
And is a very important property in
thermodynamics in

164
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,860
statistical physics, when it comes to
describing big systems.

165
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,600
The third and last example of closed
system I want

166
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,200
to discuss is very famous is called the
kicked rotor.

167
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,010
It can be presented in many ways, I
presented it here as a stick.

168
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,970
Suspended by one of the ends.

169
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:21,340
And gets

170
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,380
periodically kicked at the other end.

171
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,360
You can sort of imagine what's going on,
again

172
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,030
you will find beautiful illustrations,
animations in the internet.

173
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,080
That if you kick at the right moment the
rotor will go around and

174
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,690
around and go even all the way up and fall
down on the other side.

175
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,720
If you kick at the wrong moment, the rotor
will stay more or less where it is.

176
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,550
I've written here for your information,
how to describe this system

177
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,400
in Physics?
There are two variables.

178
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,680
I, I've written P, the angular momentum,
sometimes written, I and theta, the angle.

179
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,900
Is similar to speed and position.

180
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,550
That's the kind of variables.

181
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,360
There is a continuous time evolution you
can write

182
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,280
down, there is a kinetic energy and
potential energy.

183
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,130
For those who know distinct's from those
two.

184
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:11,650
You can create

185
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:15,630
a Lagrangian or a Hamiltonian, that's why
it's called a Hamiltonian system.

186
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,500
There's also discretized map, that
describes

187
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,080
only what happens essentially at every
kick.

188
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,580
And is, written like that.

189
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,620
This looks more or less like our logistic
map.

190
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,580
It's called the standard map.

191
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,430
I think that the message has come across.

192
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:30,280
I don't think I have to present many more
examples of chaos.

193
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,780
please, I repeat again, browse the
internet and find them there.

194
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,210
There is also a very rich mathematical

195
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,219
theory behind all these for those who are
interested.

196
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:45,125
In the next segment I will rather move to
two topics that are related to chaos.

197
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,204
And the, just for the fun of it, just to

198
00:10:47,204 --> 00:10:50,590
learn something that also related to our
topic of randomness.
