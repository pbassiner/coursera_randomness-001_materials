1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,190
Hello, welcome to the fifth lecture.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,088
After four lectures devoted to

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:09,220
defining and characterizing and producing
randomness.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,320
We are going to move to a different
perspective

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,110
which is the presence of randomness in our
world.

6
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,090
As you see the color of the lights change,
changed lightly.

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,390
And this particular lecture will be about
deterministic chaos.

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,640
The plan of the lecture is as follows.

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,200
We start

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,470
by speaking of physical determinism or
(in)determinism.

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,830
Then we devote three segments to the main
topic, which is deterministic chaos.

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,280
And the last segment the fifth will be
devoted to two related

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,620
topics, the beauty of factor curves and
the power of laws in statistics.

14
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:50,160
So let us start with physical determinism
or (in)determinism.

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,500
If you ask a physicist

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,400
in a few minutes, you will get the
following simple story.

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,590
That classical physics, the physics, let's
say until the

18
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:05,120
19th century included, is deterministic in
the sense of Laplace.

19
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,970
Remember the citation of Laplace that we
had

20
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,900
in the first lecture, where a being, that

21
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,450
an intelligence that would know everything
perfectly would

22
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,190
be able to predict the future without any
uncertainty.

23
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,700
I have to start that this is usually
identified with Newtonian physics, the

24
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,340
physics pioneered by Newton, but it

25
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,810
also included Einstein's relativity in
that sense.

26
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,000
Relativity is of course a big scientific
revolution

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,880
in many respects but not in this one.

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,320
It doesn't challenge the idea of
deterministic.

29
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,560
In fact, one may even say it's time
sensitive.

30
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,130
Then comes quantum physics, one of the,
the

31
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,990
second greatest discovery of physics in
the 20th century.

32
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,410
That is not deterministic, and

33
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,210
it's intrinsically random.

34
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,720
So this is the simple story, and at the
end of the day I will stick to it.

35
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,140
However, I want to mention that these begs
a few questions.

36
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,490
In fact it begs many questions.

37
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,610
Here is again, our simple model from
physics,

38
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,160
Classical physics - determinism; Quantum
physics - randomness.

39
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,690
What are the questions?

40
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,930
There are some questions about physics
itself.

41
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,980
For instance, the description, the simple
description,

42
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,118
Classical - deterministic.

43
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,870
Quantum - random is certainly correct,
when it come to the theory.

44
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,300
When it comes to describing the formalism,
the way mathematics are

45
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,860
done, the way physical phenomena are
described in a mathematical framework.

46
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,320
But what about nature?

47
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,560
For instance the fact that Quantum
Physics, Quantum theory sorry, is

48
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,180
random does it imply that there are really
Random Phenomena out there?

49
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,230
Or does it mean that this is just the best
theory we've

50
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,070
been able to come about with and maybe one

51
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:40,480
day someone will find something better
that is deterministic again.

52
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,320
Or on the contrary, is it possible that
everything is actually random.

53
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,220
So that Newtonian physics is deterministic
by accident.

54
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,970
That okay, we got a theory that looks
deterministic

55
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,150
but in fact everything out there is
completely unpredictable.

56
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,030
Then there are of course questions beyond
Physics,

57
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,490
or better said, does all this discussion
imply anything beyond Physics?

58
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:07,010
For instance, assuming you would conclude
to

59
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,130
physical determinism, which was the case
for

60
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,830
many centuries in Physics, of these
centuries,

61
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,450
would that imply lack of free will?

62
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,990
Or on the contrary if you now accept a, a
physical indeterminism of Quantum

63
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:24,590
Physics, isn't this a proof of free will?
In order to go deeper into

64
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,760
these topics, let me introduce what they
call the Conspiracy Theater.

65
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,260
It's the question that probably each of us
have asked a few times.

66
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,030
And humanities have asked a need for many
years, namely whether

67
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,230
everything that we observe with our senses
is in fact an illusion.

68
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,543
And we are just acting in a theater play
set up

69
00:03:43,543 --> 00:03:47,020
by, let's see what are the options that
have been proposed.

70
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,740
Of course one of the options is theater
plays set

71
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,030
up by an all powerful God.

72
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,270
This is similar to the position that
Bishop

73
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,960
George Berkeley, the famous Irish
philosopher was upholding.

74
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,030
Although we have to say that in Berkeley's
philosophy the souls had some freedom.

75
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,290
It was only the physical world that was
illusion created by God.

76
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,920
But of course we can quote many other
people who may have a

77
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,570
much more deterministic view, even where,
even behaviour is determined in the play.

78
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,004
In the movie The Matrix, that you are

79
00:04:17,004 --> 00:04:22,110
certainly familiar with, the human beings
that are prisoners

80
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,380
of their dreams are in fact playing in a

81
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,960
theater set up by robots, who have taken
control.

82
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,660
In some science fiction stories you can
find that we human beings and our world

83
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,360
is nothing else than a big computer

84
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,400
game being played by an alien superior
civilization.

85
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,838
Or you may just say that nobody

86
00:04:40,838 --> 00:04:43,590
has really, no intelligence has really set
up these

87
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,299
theater, it's just the universe is
deterministic by itself.

88
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,920
This topics are very old and very famous

89
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,750
in the history of humanity, for instance
the

90
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,750
allegory of the cave by Plato, theater
Plays

91
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,920
like Life is a dream by Calderon dela
Varga.

92
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,610
And many others that can be quoted here,
brings up a similar idea.

93
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,960
Anyway, you understand what I'm speaking
about, let's see if someone who upholds

94
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,750
this view can be convinced by quantum
physics that this is wrong.

95
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,660
The answer is clearly not.

96
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,990
Obviously someone who has such a world
view, would not be

97
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,810
able to be convinced that this is wrong by
physics, by observation.

98
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,020
Why?

99
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,140
Well, simply because if, if you believe

100
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,580
that everything is a, a deterministic
play, even

101
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,700
the fact that we observe Quantum
Phenomena, and

102
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,090
that they look random to us, it's
predetermined.

103
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:35,110
So in fact such a world view cannot be
falsified.

104
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,890
Now, does it make sense to continue

105
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,270
following this lecture and speaking about
randomness?

106
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,310
It does.

107
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:45,890
Even if you believe in such a world view,
I don't, personally, but of course

108
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:50,620
I leave you free to believe in it, it
makes sense to speak of randomness.

109
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:56,230
because as usual, we have to specify for
whom the phenomenon is unpredictable.

110
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,740
Let us discuss that point.
Keep calm.

111
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,110
Let's not go too much excited about
philosophy.

112
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,350
Let's keep calm and ask, for whom it is
random?

113
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:16,410
So, if we are a being in our universe,
with limited computational power, then

114
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,260
that being cannot predict Quantum
Phenomena in

115
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,600
Physics, and cannot predict chaotic
Classical Phenomena.

116
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,000
If you take a being that is in our
universe but with

117
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,070
unlimited computational power, this would
be

118
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,030
the intelligence Laplace was speaking
about.

119
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,430
Then all Classical Phenomena would become

120
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,600
predictable but Quantum Phenomena would
not.

121
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,980
What happens if outside our we are
universe, in particular, outside out time.

122
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,290
A being in that situation, I would say it
does

123
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:48,280
not make sense to speak of prediction in
that case.

124
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:48,730
I thought this

125
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:54,030
being is just looking at our world and
then it's just passive vision.

126
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,130
Or that being is actually actively messing
up with our world

127
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,650
and this is would be decision and this
being is in control.

128
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,370
Now to be sure we are in the first
category

129
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:08,370
ourselves, we are in our universe and with
limited computational power.

130
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:13,140
So for us, both Quantum Phenomena and
chaotic Classical Phenomena are random.

131
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,810
Are unpredictable.

132
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,640
It's not impossible for us to imagine
being in

133
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,700
the place of the intelligence that Laplace
was speaking about.

134
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,830
In that case, we can understand that there

135
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,100
is a difference between Quantum Phenomena
and Classical Phenomena.

136
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,520
Its very hard to us to conceive what it
would

137
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,100
mean to be outside our universe and
outside our time.

138
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,240
So I will not deal with that option
anymore during these lectures.

139
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,180
Let's say it again.

140
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,600
What is Physical Determinism?

141
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,250
Is phenomena that can be predicted

142
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,805
with unlimited computational resources and
physical

143
00:07:47,805 --> 00:07:51,585
(in)determinism, a phenomenon cannot be
predicted

144
00:07:51,585 --> 00:07:54,770
with, even with unlimited computation or
resources.

145
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,540
So if a phenomenon is deterministic,

146
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,220
the information is already fully available
now.

147
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,390
It's just a matter of extracting it from
the present state of the universe.

148
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,153
Whereas an (in)deterministic phenomenon is
a

149
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:11,240
phenomenon that creates new information
the universe.

150
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,180
Nevertheless, some deterministic phenomena
may be unpredictable, if

151
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,320
we have limited resources, as we do have.

152
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,220
And this the case of deterministic case,
it will be the main topic of this lecture.

153
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,710
Let me just finish by analogy.

154
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,010
We have seen in lecture two, the security
of the

155
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,250
RSA protocol, and the security of the
one-time pad protocol.

156
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:30,630
You remember

157
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,790
the security of RSA was guaranteed under

158
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,960
computational assumptions of the power of
the historical.

159
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,010
The security of one time part is
guaranteed unconditionally.

160
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,490
It's similar to this distinction between
physical determinism,

161
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,410
but chaotic that cannot be predicted, and
physical indeterminism.
