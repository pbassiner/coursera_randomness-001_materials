1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,138
I'm going to, to introduce the idea

2
00:00:03,138 --> 00:00:07,000
of deterministic chaos, with a very
familiar example.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,770
The example of predicting the weather, or
weather forecast.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,170
How is weather forecast down today.

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,650
The recipe goes as follows.

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,460
There is a preparation phase, in which one
has to define a

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,790
grid on a portion of the Earth, and define
the meaningful variables.

8
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,560
That are going to be considered

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,080
inside the grid.

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,140
Typically, the pressure, the temperature,
the humidity, the wind, whatever

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,610
is needed to describe the weather in an
accurate way.

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,240
Then, one is to specify the initial
conditions in each point of the grid.

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,120
This is the value of the variables now.
What is the weather like today?

14
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:51,810
And then what uses evolution equations
from physics,

15
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,320
from fluid dynamics, from thermodynamics
to compute how

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,430
the weather will evolve in the coming
days?

17
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,200
Let us give a look to the computation of
complexity of these procedure.

18
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,570
Assuming for a moment the evolution
equations are perfectly correct, if I want

19
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,380
more precision, I will need to create a
smaller mesh in the grid.

20
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:16,860
And this leads to

21
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,140
more computation.
How much more?

22
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,580
Here is a grid with two cubes,

23
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,460
that describes the weather to some decent
precision.

24
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,550
And I want to double the precision.

25
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,210
Then, these cubes are three dimensional.

26
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,070
So, each time I double the precision, it

27
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,140
creates 8 cubes in each of the previous
cubes.

28
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,320
This means that each time the precision is
double,

29
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,100
the number of cells is multiplied by 8.

30
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,320
Or in other terms, the number of cells
grows as 8 to the power n, with

31
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,390
n the number of times the, we want to
increase the precision by a factor of 2.

32
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,380
This is one is exponential growth.

33
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,700
That mean that, the computational
complexity is very high.

34
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,860
What about the evolution equations
themselves?

35
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,400
There are many.

36
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,650
I'm not going to enter into details but
one

37
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,552
that is inescapable is the Navier-Stokes
equation,

38
00:02:10,552 --> 00:02:13,170
that describe the motion of a fluid.

39
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,250
Here I've written it.

40
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,470
On the left hand side you find the
variables

41
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,560
that describe the fluid, the density and
the speed.

42
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,780
On the right hand side you find all that
acts on the fluid.

43
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,810
The pressure, some form of stress.

44
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:32,540
The forces,

45
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,500
for instance gravity that obviously as on
the air molecules as well.

46
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,248
And these variables require further
modelling because they

47
00:02:42,248 --> 00:02:44,988
depend themselves on the density on the
speed.

48
00:02:44,988 --> 00:02:49,622
This equation is of the same form as the
famous Newton equation f equal to ma.

49
00:02:49,622 --> 00:02:52,709
In fact, as written here, would be rather
ma equal to f.

50
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,560
The acceleration is the property of the
particle in the force, that f

51
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,161
is the force that acts on it, and here we
have the

52
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:04,990
acts of the fluid on the left and the
forces on the right.

53
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,300
I'm not going to speak a lot about these
equation but just want to mention that it

54
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,920
is not even known in the most general

55
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,110
case whether these equation have a
solution at all.

56
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,760
It is known that has a solutions

57
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,910
in some modified version, in some
simplified version,

58
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,910
but whether it has a solution in general,
it is one of the most complicated

59
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,378
open problems in mathematics.
So with this what one can do?

60
00:03:26,378 --> 00:03:30,150
Well, here is something that a person
called

61
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,136
Edward Lorenz debuted in 1960s or end of
1950s.

62
00:03:34,136 --> 00:03:39,010
He took the Navier-Stokes equations
already with some approximation.

63
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,450
He added something that is called

64
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,730
the Condition of Incompressibility for the
fluid.

65
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,555
He added an equation for heat transfer.

66
00:03:45,555 --> 00:03:48,680
Notice that in the Navier-Stokes

67
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,880
equation we don't have any mention of

68
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,060
temperature that is obviously an important
variable.

69
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,450
When it comes to weather, he need a

70
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,670
few further manipulations, some
assumptions on the physics and

71
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,640
you got the system of free equations
written on

72
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,370
the right, for the whole weather, on a
surface.

73
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,000
On a surface of the earth.

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,800
So, what are the characteristics of three
equations.

75
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,700
First of all notice that, we have only
three real numbers there x,

76
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,390
y, and z.

77
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:18,560
We don't have anymore vector fields like
the speed before.

78
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,460
X is related to the velocity, and y

79
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,470
and z are related to the variations of
temperature.

80
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,740
The original Lorenz model had 12
variables, but Lorenz

81
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,820
himself simplified down to this one a few
years later.

82
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,330
Also we have removed all the derivatives
in space.

83
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:38,830
In the previous

84
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,590
equation, the Navier-Stokes equation,
there were variations

85
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:46,230
of speed and of pressure, across the
space.

86
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,740
Here everything has been absolved in the

87
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,700
assumptions and the manipulations that
have been done.

88
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,930
And we are left only with derivatives in
time.

89
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,180
This is what's called an ordinary
differential equation.

90
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,330
And, another noticeable feature is that
there are no

91
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:04,350
linear terms, terms where the variable
apply, appear not

92
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,500
by themselves in this case they appear by
multiplying two of

93
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,150
them instead in the second equation and XY
in the third equation.

94
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,940
And we come to the discovery of

95
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,490
the domesticate cares it was a serendipity
discovery.

96
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,620
Serendipity means precisely a discovery
that is made by chance, Lorenz,

97
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:29,140
around 1960 bought a computer, and tried
to do computer prediction,

98
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,530
computer forecast of the weather with his
no linear set of equations.

99
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,600
One day he decided to check his program,
by

100
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,990
running the calculation again for the same
initial conditions.

101
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,810
And what he found is that after some time,
the prediction changed completely.

102
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,420
So, at the beginning, he thought it was a
bug in the program or in the computer.

103
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,500
But looking more carefully, he realized
what really happened.

104
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,140
That he had not used exactly the

105
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,080
same initial conditions.

106
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,620
He had rounded them to the 4th significant
digit.

107
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,415
So instead of, let's say, 5.0013 He wrote
5.001.

108
00:06:03,415 --> 00:06:08,260
So, what he discovered is that the
computer was working but the system

109
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,340
of equation was behaving very differently
for

110
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,500
some initial conditions that were very
similar.

111
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,380
It was sensitivity to initial conditions
that led to the deviation.

112
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:24,640
Later he wrote, this discovered in 1963 in
a paper, and in 1972, in a talk

113
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,810
he mentioned for the first time his
metaphor

114
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,190
of the butterfly effect, that nowadays
everybody probably knows.

115
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:34,000
Namely that the motion of the wings of a
butterfly in Brazil

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,540
can influence the weather in the United
States a few weeks later.

117
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,900
The explosion of interest in this topic
happened only 1975.

118
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,550
Before we move to more chaos, let me
stress

119
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,805
a few things.

120
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:46,570
[UNKNOWN]

121
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,870
We are here, we have seen a

122
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,270
simple deterministic and unpredictable
system of equations.

123
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,140
I want to stress that the fact that the
weather itself is hard

124
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:01,250
to predict is a no-brainier, because the
system is just too complex to model.

125
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,160
If I would only go around saying the
weather is hard to predict, you could

126
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,970
say well that's not a real discovery, it's
the same as the noise of last week.

127
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,590
That's too many variables.
However what Lorenz

128
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,760
discovered is that even simple
mathematical systems, only

129
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,240
three variables, ordinary differential
equations can be chaotic.

130
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,100
In the literature on chaos by the way, the
word chaotic is referred

131
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,360
to precisely this behaviour or sensitivity
to

132
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,570
initial conditions of the variables under
study.

133
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:31,640
And randonmess, random is used for noise
coming from other sources.

134
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,600
And let us just finish by noticing that
even if sometimes we complain,

135
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,780
prediction of the weather is quite an
achievement.

136
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,620
It's not an easy task.
