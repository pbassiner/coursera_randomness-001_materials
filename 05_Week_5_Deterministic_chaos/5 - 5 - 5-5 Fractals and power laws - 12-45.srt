1
00:00:01,085 --> 00:00:05,275
We've come to last segment of these
lecture that as I announced is

2
00:00:05,275 --> 00:00:10,660
devoted to two topics to related to chaos
and also related to each other.

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,170
The topic of fractals and the topic of
power laws.

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,020
Let us start with a very innocent-looking
map.

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,010
You remember our logistic map.

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,590
This one, is another possible map.
It takes a number, z.

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,980
This time it must be a complex number.

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,710
Squares it, here I have a reminder of how
you square a complex number.

9
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,290
You add another complex number c, always
the same.

10
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:41,910
And this new number defines the number z,
at the following iteration.

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,310
So you see there below how it goes, you
start with z0.

12
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,860
z1 would be z0 squared plus c.

13
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,850
z2 would be z0 squared plus c, squared
plus c, and so on.

14
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:59,110
Z square, also for complex number, is a
function that normally grows.

15
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,360
So, in fact, it can be checked.

16
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,508
It's not difficult to realize that for
most values of z0

17
00:01:05,508 --> 00:01:09,950
and c, the iteration of zk will just tend
to infinity.

18
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,590
Zk squared would be bigger than zk and
adding c, it

19
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:19,360
may also make it bigger and essentially
the whole thing explodes.

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,730
Of course, there are values of z0 and c
for which the map goes to 0.

21
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,320
Or for which it remains bounded.

22
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,120
So, we can ask a few questions.

23
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,090
For instance, if I fix c, what are the
values

24
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,670
of z0 such that z k is escapes to
infinity?

25
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,176
Or conversely, what are the values of z0,
such that k, zk remains bounded?

26
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,020
You can also ask the opposite question.

27
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,890
If I fixed at z0, what are the value

28
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,990
of c such that the iteration escapes to
infinity?

29
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,470
The answer to the first question is called
a julia set.

30
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,630
In fact, there is a particular case of a
julia set.

31
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,910
I should say, julia probably because its a
French mathematician.

32
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,990
So the question I repeat it is for a fixed
value of c,

33
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,170
which are the values of z0, such that the
iteration blows up?

34
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,320
Okay, if c is equal to 0, then the
iteration is

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,810
zk plus 1 is equal to zk squared.
We know the answer to that one, is

36
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:31,070
a circle of radius one, If z0 is smaller

37
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,440
than 1, the iteration will go to 0.

38
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,160
The square, square, square are numbers
more than 1, goes to 0.

39
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,240
If they are, the z0 is larger than 1, it
will blow up.

40
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,050
If z0 is equal to 1, it stays there.

41
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,456
Okay, so what happens if we change c
naught?

42
00:02:47,456 --> 00:02:54,350
Here is a negative c and you see that the
set is not easy to identify.

43
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,670
By the way, I want to stress that the

44
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,880
boundary is essentially what matters here.

45
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:05,210
Inside the boundary what is red in this
drawing, are the points that will go to 0.

46
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,710
Outside the boundary are all the points

47
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,770
that will go to infinity, at different
speeds.

48
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,060
That's why there are some coloring there
that is

49
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,040
for artistic reasons But what really
matters is the boundary.

50
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,940
The boundary of the points that do not
blow up, and do not go to 0.

51
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,890
Okay, so, let's change again a little bit
c.

52
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,792
And suddenly

53
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:27,330
we see, amazingly complex and beautiful
behavior of the boundary.

54
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:32,950
The set, that before was connect has blown
up, and is kind of stars.

55
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,090
And you see I've modified just the
imaginary part of

56
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,303
c from 0.6 to, sorry minus 0.6 to minus
0.66.

57
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:44,370
What happens if one takes a much larger
value?

58
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,270
Then as expected, essentially everything
blows up.

59
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,930
You can see some islands somewhere, some
specific points where it

60
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,520
doesn't blow up, but it's completely
disconnected and not very interesting.

61
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,710
So here's another beautiful example just
for the pleasure of

62
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:03,430
the eyes, is c equals 0.35 plus i times
0.36.

63
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,510
And again I want to stress that the Julia
set is the boundary.

64
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:13,310
And what is inside the boundary here in
orange, is what, goes to 0.

65
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,570
What is the outside the boundary here in
green is what goes to infinity.

66
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,680
So you see how a very simple map like,
square the number, add a

67
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,590
complex number and repeat it again, can be
twice to extremely complicated structures.

68
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,270
Now the answer to the other question is
even more famous.

69
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,320
It's the famous Mandelbrot set.

70
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,315
So for fixed z and I, z0 and I chose z0
equal

71
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:39,160
to 0.

72
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:45,060
What are the values of c such that now the
iteration will explode?

73
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,538
That's the result.

74
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:49,810
And again what you have to concentrate on,
is the boundary of that set.

75
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,840
In the blue, light blue region, at the

76
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,410
point for which the iteration would go to
0.

77
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,640
The red points are the boundary.

78
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,050
Outside the boundary, you have all the
points that

79
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,500
will go to infinity again at different
speeds, and that's

80
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,980
what allows people to call us and create
more beautiful images.

81
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,370
There is in fact a relationship between
the Mandelbrot set and the Julia set,

82
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:17,310
if you plot the Julia set's corresponding
to the c, remember zero zero was a

83
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,437
circle, then we had this one, zero point,
minus 0.21 minus 0.6.

84
00:05:22,437 --> 00:05:24,890
The other one, the beautiful one.

85
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,710
There, another beautiful one up there.
One completely

86
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,790
is connected out there.

87
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,620
You may guess what is the relation, and in
fact, it's true.

88
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,780
Is that the Julia set is connected, if and
only if,

89
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,620
the point c is inside the curve defined by
the Mandelbrot boundary.

90
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,600
And it's disconnected if it is outside.

91
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,000
Another very famous problem with the
Mandelbrot set, is it's self similarity.

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,840
Supposed you zone in, on that path for
instance, you see

93
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,830
the yellow dot down there, and also some
small, smaller yellow dots.

94
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,120
If you would zoom more and more in,

95
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,490
you find that these structures have the
same form.

96
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,280
As the original Mandelbrot set.

97
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,670
Again now don't do it here because you

98
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:12,000
can find amazing animations of these on
the internet.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,340
You just go and find them.

100
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,830
But it's probably the self-similarity is
what I'm going

101
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,910
to explore for the next topic which is the
power

102
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:22,330
of laws.
So what is self-similarity?

103
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:25,220
Well, it means that it's similar to itself
but in this case it

104
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,760
means that it looks the same when you zoom
in, in some places.

105
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,710
You have some visual examples in nature

106
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,640
and that's why fractals is kind of
complicated

107
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,680
patterns look very familiar to us because
they

108
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,710
remind us of something we see in nature.

109
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,220
For instance, stones, are a very clear
example.

110
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,500
If you see a photo

111
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,640
of only stones, you don't know if these
are boulders or just small pebbles.

112
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,960
And that's the reason why for instance,

113
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,900
it's hard to estimate distances on
mountains.

114
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,660
If you go to an excursion in the mountain,
you know it's very hard

115
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,580
to estimate how far a peak is, because the
stones look all the same.

116
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,110
Another example are coast lines.

117
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,163
Even galaxies and large structures in the
universe form fractal sets.

118
00:07:07,518 --> 00:07:09,540
Examples of self-similarity mathematics
apart from

119
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:14,590
fractals of these power laws that I'm
going to present in the next fuse lights.

120
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,330
So, this is a very simple example.

121
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,310
A power law is nothing that a function
that is

122
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,210
a constant and then x to the power of
something.

123
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,260
Something doesn't need to be an integer
number, it can

124
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,850
be any real number, what that means if I
zoom?

125
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:33,030
By zoom I mean that I changed the variable
x to variable y, that is b times x.

126
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,700
Is a scaling up,

127
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,285
or scaling down if b is more than 1.

128
00:07:36,285 --> 00:07:41,220
And F of y is F of b of x, become C

129
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,930
times b to the power alpha times x to the
power alpha.

130
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,760
So it's another constant, times x to the
power alpha.

131
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,140
So the function looks exactly the same, if
I zoom.

132
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,160
It's just the constant in front of it
changes.

133
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,790
I will explain these with very relevant
example, which is the Gutenberg-Ricther

134
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,280
law for earthquakes.
That is an empirical law.

135
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,730
It's hard to demonstrate why people have
tried.

136
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,980
But it's something very hm, matched by
observations.

137
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,570
Here is a law that relates number of
earthquakes in

138
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,680
a given region with their amplitude of the
seismic waves.

139
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:23,450
And it says that, there are essentially,
this kind of power law.

140
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,840
A to the power of minus b,

141
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,098
b a number close to one.

142
00:08:27,098 --> 00:08:30,330
between the number of earthquakes and the
number, and their amplitude.

143
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,760
So,you find that the larger the amplitude,

144
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,180
the fewer earthquakes are there, it's
called.

145
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,920
Notice that this is usually given as an
exponential law,

146
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,060
but by defining the magnitude as the
logarithm of the amplitude.

147
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,650
So in fact, it's a power law but you

148
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,800
can define the logarithm and then it
becomes, looks, it,

149
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,490
you may look, to make it exponential.

150
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,178
So, what I want ask is the following
question,

151
00:08:56,178 --> 00:09:00,130
it sounds artificial, but I will bring it
home later.

152
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,040
Does nature choose earthquakes by tossing
coins?

153
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,250
What do I mean by that?

154
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,770
It means that, there is an earthquake of
amplitude 1.

155
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:13,220
Each time something happens and
equivalently

156
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,050
to tossing a coin and finding 10.

157
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,980
That is earthquake of amplitude 2.

158
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,385
Each time a sequence 00 is found in a fair
coin.

159
00:09:21,385 --> 00:09:24,570
Is an earthquake amplitude 3, each time a
sequence

160
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,900
000 is find in a fair coin and so on.

161
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,790
Do the statistics of earthquakes, as a
function of

162
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:34,520
the amplitude, behave like the statistics
of a fair coin?

163
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,180
Well, let's check.

164
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,380
For a fair coin, you have this ratio.

165
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,580
Remember the fair coin, the probability is
1 over 2 to the n.

166
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,705
So, the number of sequences with n 0s.

167
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:52,786
Is related to number of sequences of m 0s
by that exponential relation.

168
00:09:52,786 --> 00:09:57,730
For the Gutenberg-Richter law, the number
of earthquakes

169
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,870
of amplitude n is related to the number

170
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:05,943
of earthquakes of amplitude m, by a
fraction n over m to the power minus b.

171
00:10:05,943 --> 00:10:10,488
Again,b is approximately 1.
So, let's compare the two.

172
00:10:10,488 --> 00:10:15,460
Let's assume that an earthquake of
magnitude 1, so amplitude

173
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,910
10 happens every hour in some particular
region of the world.

174
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,110
What is the frequency of earthquakes of
magnitude 8?

175
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:26,520
So, the amplitude 10 to the 8.

176
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,770
Like the most destructive ones that we
have here on earth.

177
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,080
If

178
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:36,970
I take the Gutenberg-Richter law, then
these magnitude 8 earthquake happen

179
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,550
once every ten to the seventh hours which
means every 1100 years.

180
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,520
Of, of course, it's

181
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,120
a very approximate model, but it makes
sense.

182
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,220
Fortunate these very destructive
earthquakes in a given part of

183
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,260
the world happen, yeah indeed every
century, every some centuries.

184
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:58,970
If you use the fair coin, these
destructive earthquakes

185
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:04,820
should happen every 2 to the 10 to the 8
hours,

186
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,570
minus a 10 it doesn't really matter.
Now for comparison the age of the

187
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:12,120
universe at 13 billion years is 2 to the
46 hours.

188
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,120
So essentially it means,that if the
earthquakes would follow

189
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,820
a fair coin statistics, destructive
earthquakes would never happen.

190
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,190
Which would be very good for us but that's
not how nature works.

191
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,620
The answer is no it does not.

192
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:31,060
The statistics of earthquakes does not
follow the ones of fair coin.

193
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,850
Now the last bad news is that, as you
certainly know

194
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,340
the fact that we know the statistical
earthquakes doesn't

195
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,860
mean that we are able to predict them
better.

196
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,620
It just that we know how probable it is,
that a destructive earthquake will happen.

197
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:50,340
We've come to the end of this lecture 5,
so let me summarize, the main message I

198
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:55,090
want to send across was that sometimes
deterministic does

199
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,460
not mean predictable because we don't have
unlimited computational

200
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,450
power and precision.

201
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:04,950
I started with an introduction on physical
determinism and indeterminism.

202
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,240
We discussed precisely this topic of chaos
of

203
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,990
the deterministic systems that can be
unpredictable nevertheless.

204
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,680
I gave a few examples; complex systems

205
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,145
like the weather that would rather be
called

206
00:12:17,145 --> 00:12:20,060
noise; simple systems like models of the

207
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,280
weather, the Lorenz model or the logistic
map.

208
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:23,700
And even

209
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,010
closed systems, systems that do not have
dissipation.

210
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,420
But there are many body systems like the
many planet motion.

211
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,760
And in the lecture after showing some

212
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,790
beautiful factors, I mention that there
exists statistics

213
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:40,030
out there in the world that behave like
power laws and not like fair coins.

214
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,730
Thank you and see you next week.
