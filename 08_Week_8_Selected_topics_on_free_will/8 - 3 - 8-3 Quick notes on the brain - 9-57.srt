1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:06,610
We've just seen how freewill and the
practice of science are related.

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,250
Now let us study the brain a little bit.

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,860
Just the science of the brain.

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,700
Can the science of the brain tell us
something about freewill?

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,670
A couple of no-brainers.

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:21,700
The human brain and not only the human
brain in fact.

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,630
Many brains are extremely complex.

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,250
Physical and chemical processes happen in
the brain.

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,040
This is also something absolutely obvious,
and well, the brain

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,430
is somehow related to free will, to
consciousness, and these notions.

11
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,410
Because we know that the processes that

12
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,690
happen there, are related precisely to our
decisions.

13
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:52,170
So the science of the brain is certainly
relevant for the discussion of free will.

14
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,230
This is just the introduction of why I'm

15
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,500
speaking of the brain and not about the
hands.

16
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:03,440
Given where we come from in the previous
lectures, it is relevant

17
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,236
to ask whether quantum physics Has
something to do with a brain.

18
00:01:07,236 --> 00:01:12,300
And again a no-brainer, something clear

19
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:17,420
that quantum physics describes, chemistry
describes processes.

20
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,770
So ultimately quantum physics describes
the chemical processes

21
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,680
or the electrical processes, that are
happening in

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,100
the brain like everywhere else.
That's not the question.

23
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,360
But the question is, maybe the tempting
question.

24
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,100
The further tempting question is, can
quantum

25
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,610
indeterminism be somehow related to free
will?

26
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,120
I want to make a couple of comments about
this question.

27
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,140
First of all, I think it's a

28
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,135
valid scientific question because it's in
principle testable.

29
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,140
It has a funny status

30
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,960
in the sense that people who are
materialist.

31
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,060
Like the idea, because in their approach
this would prove

32
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,430
that our free will is nothing else than a
physical process.

33
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,310
Quantum of a physical process.

34
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:10,370
Interestingly enough, also people who are
dualists like the idea, because this

35
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:14,200
idea would allow the, the ghost that is in
us to shape

36
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,270
decisions without violating the laws of
physics.

37
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,300
So it's a intriguing question, whether

38
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,540
quantum indeterminism is related to free
will.

39
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,720
My stance is negative.

40
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,760
I think the answer is no.

41
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,220
Most people do think like that, but there
are also quite

42
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,900
a few people who still hope that there is
something there.

43
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,260
Let me list the prudent objections

44
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,760
that one can make with this idea of
quantum indetermination

45
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,840
having something to do with free decisions
in the brain.

46
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,050
First of all, there is no evidence of the
use of quantum statistics.

47
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:59,870
In the brain, of the use of these quantum
phenomena, like the measurements, like

48
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,210
interferences, and follow the measurement
as we

49
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,700
have seen in the lectures six and seven.

50
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,840
In particular, recently, some people have
asked whether the brain could be a

51
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,200
quantum computer, and I like the reply
that Scott Aaronson and other people give.

52
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,210
To these questions, they, well, we don't
seem to be particularly good

53
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:21,970
at factoring integers, which is the task
that would distinguish a quantum computer.

54
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,890
In fact, even more, there is still very
little

55
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,210
evidence of quantum phenomena, or let's
say purely quantum phenomena.

56
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,720
Again, in all of chemistry, ultimately
there is some quantum

57
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,940
there, but.

58
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,820
Purely quantum in the sense of intrinsic
randomness in

59
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,330
environment that are hot and wet, like the
brain.

60
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,410
For me, even more important than this
objection that there

61
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,800
is little evidence at the end of the day
one

62
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,970
would find evidence one day, is the fact
that the

63
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,929
explanation does not take into account the
complexity of the brain.

64
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,800
All that people do differently.
If it would be true that

65
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:05,330
quantum indeterminism is the ultimate
source of our free will, then a photon

66
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,700
on a beam-splitter would exhibit something
that is similar to our free will.

67
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,520
I do think however that the complexity of
our brain

68
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:18,560
must play a role in allowing free will to
be possible.

69
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,260
I think that maybe emergence is a more
interesting concept.

70
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,340
Emergence is defined as, cooperative
phenomenon in complex systems that

71
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,400
could not have been predicted by studying
the individual component.

72
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,540
And clearly, complex systems does fit the
brain.

73
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,020
In fact, the brain is probably the
paradigmatic example of a complex system.

74
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,780
Another instance of a widely used concept,
in this course we

75
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,260
didn't have time to speak about
complexity, again, follow the video

76
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,630
with someone else teaching a full course
on

77
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,900
complexity somewhere on the internet and
on the MOOCs.

78
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,990
Anyway, just to give an example of what
emergence means, how comes that many

79
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:06,150
atoms under some conditions form a solid
or under other conditions form a liquid?

80
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,400
And with higher order imposed on them, the
same atoms,

81
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,410
or atoms of the same species, form a
living being?

82
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,450
Where does this order come from?

83
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:21,260
Clearly A living being is not just a lump
of atoms.

84
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,510
There is some organization.

85
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,390
There is some order there that matters.

86
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,370
This is the idea of emergence that

87
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,600
starting from the individual atoms, it
would be

88
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,270
very, very hard if not impossible to
reconstruct

89
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,169
the functioning of a living being for
instance.

90
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,300
Without going so far, you will have seen
photos

91
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,660
of the wind shaping the fumes.

92
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,310
So this means, we have many grains of sand
that form some patterns.

93
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,740
The patterns cannot be predicted by
studying each individual grain of sand.

94
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,050
You really have to think that are many
grains of sand and somehow would have

95
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,700
put them together under some influence,
external

96
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,040
influence of the wind, that create those
patterns.

97
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,440
And a dramatic example of the behavior of
crowds, it

98
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,560
is well known that if you are in a crowd,

99
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,060
you may end up doing things that you
alone, you would not do,

100
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,790
just because the crowd, it's doing it, so
you go along with it.

101
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,610
Applied to the brain, Emergence means that
it is probably impossible to describe the

102
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:25,570
activity of the brain, by focusing only on
elementary constituents or processes.

103
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,080
Like focusing only on the neurons,
focusing

104
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,170
only on how the neurosignal is
transmitted.

105
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:37,990
It probably does not recover It certainly
does not recover what the brain does.

106
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,810
And now if we think of something very

107
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:45,380
advanced like our free will, then most
probably

108
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,940
elementary processes will not be enough to
describe

109
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,880
this process, this, this, this evidence of
free will.

110
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,850
Let us relate complexity with randomness,
since at the end

111
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,890
of the day, also it is a course of
randomness.

112
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:03,190
So how do complexity scholars look at
randomness?

113
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,990
Here's a graph, and you have on the

114
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,980
horizontal axis, disorder, on the vertical
axis, complexity.

115
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,090
In the corner down there.

116
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,490
Low, low complexity and low disorder,
they're the simple pattern.

117
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,500
You can think of a triangle and geometric

118
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,990
patterns, there are geometric patterns or
you can

119
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,850
think of a sequence, very orderly
sequence.

120
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,120
We know also that there, there is no
random.

121
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,560
And it's other angle with very

122
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,240
high disorder, you would put precisely
randomness.

123
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,880
The outcome of a fair coin is

124
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,560
completely disordered, it's unpredictable
what's going to happen.

125
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,840
But it's not very complex.

126
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,820
You don't need a lot of complexity, you
just need a fair coin.

127
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,230
Now,

128
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,440
what is complexity?

129
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,490
Complexity is something in between, what
maybe is not

130
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:55,198
completely random, in fact, there is
higher order in patterns.

131
00:07:55,198 --> 00:08:01,360
But it requires complex precisely systems.

132
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,600
An example I want to give here is the
digits of pi.

133
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,020
If you look at the digits of pi and nobody

134
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,860
tells you what they are, well it looks
completely random.

135
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,970
However if someone tells you what they
are, well there is order.

136
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,620
It's clear algorithm.

137
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,110
Related to something that you would not
have seen by just looking at the digits.

138
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,890
This is an example, of course, there are
many other examples.

139
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:28,450
The brain is clearly an example of high
complexity, and

140
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,030
there must be a little bit of disorder,
because otherwise,

141
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,070
brain would be a crystal, with all the
atoms arranged

142
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,460
in perfect patterns, it would not show
such a complexity.

143
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,000
But is not a random

144
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,520
object, clearly the brain is not a random
assembly of atoms.

145
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,980
Is not a random assembly of neurons.

146
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,980
So the takeaway message from, for us.
Again you can read books and website.

147
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,660
So we'll put some links later on
complexity.

148
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,230
Is that complex is different from random.

149
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,570
And the brain is complex rather than
random.

150
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:04,040
Of course, you could use a complex
phenomena as a random number generator in

151
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,120
suffice it's how to predict, but it is not
the same.

152
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,550
So this is my bottom line, that the brain
is probably more complex than random.

153
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:20,030
Now I've brought up so far a lot of
interesting topics, extremely exciting.

154
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:24,060
Free will, moral responsibility, the
brain, complexity.

155
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,860
The moral responsibility of scientists.

156
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,500
Why we should not cheat, and so on.

157
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,650
I would have to leave any deepening of
these notions to your personal inquiry.

158
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,290
We don't have time in this course, it was
not the focus

159
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,850
of this course to develop these topics, at
least not this year.

160
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,060
If I repeat it next year, maybe I will
spend more time on this.

161
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,700
The last segment will be devoted, however
to presenting one of the

162
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:53,740
most discussed experiments in the science
of the brain which is Lebit's experiment.

163
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,990
So, let us conclude with that.
