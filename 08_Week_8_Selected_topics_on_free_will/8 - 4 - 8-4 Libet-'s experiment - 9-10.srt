1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:02,420
The last segment of this lecture is

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:06,040
devoted to the great milestone of the
neuroscience

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,400
of freewill, which is the series of

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,480
experiments conducted by Benjamin Libet in
the 1980s.

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,250
In order to describe what Libet has done I

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:20,130
have to introduce some observable quantity
that has been noticed.

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,190
A few years before he started working, is
called the readiness potential.

8
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,240
So the task is very simple, is a subject

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,080
is asked to move a finger, and the fact
the

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,840
finger moved would be detected by the fact
that a

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,609
button would be pushed and the button
sends the signal.

12
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,820
So the subject moves the finger at some
point

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,230
and this defines the time 0 of the
experiment.

14
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,860
What was done on some patients that were
undergoing

15
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,146
some open brain surgery with of course
their consentment was to measure.

16
00:00:55,146 --> 00:01:01,440
The voltage of the electric signal, the
neuronal signal,

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,860
in the relevant part of the brain, and
what was

18
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,770
observed in that particular experiment is
that the signal starts

19
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,550
more or less half a second before the
finger moves.

20
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,980
This is certainly longer than the time a
signal just needs to

21
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,140
propagate from the brain to the arm and to
the finger.

22
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,610
But it's not a big problem in the

23
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,750
sense there is nothing mind-boggling here,
just the brain.

24
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,120
Half a second before moving the finger
starts some electric

25
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,460
signal that will ultimately end up in the
finger moving.

26
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:39,214
Libet added something to this.
What he added is a clock.

27
00:01:39,214 --> 00:01:42,080
He asked the subject

28
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:49,320
not only to push the button at some point
when he or she feels like, but to indicate

29
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,670
at what time on a clock he or she

30
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,830
has taken the conscious decision of moving
the finger.

31
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:00,870
So the clock is moving by discreet steps,
there is a dot there moving.

32
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:07,100
And the subject will say, I took the
conscious decision of pushing the

33
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,080
button when the dot was in that particular
position.

34
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,890
And now the amazing result is that when
all the data are processed.

35
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,621
Libet and his team found out that the
conscious is

36
00:02:20,621 --> 00:02:27,320
taken only 0.2 seconds approximately,
before the motion of the finger.

37
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,700
Now, the fact that it's before the motion
of the

38
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,680
finger is not a big deal, of course, as
expected.

39
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,110
But what

40
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,297
is really mind boggling is that the
consciousness seems

41
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:42,470
to happen after the electric signal has
already started in the brain.

42
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,810
So the big question is, does our brain
decide for us?

43
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,180
What happens in our brain?

44
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,040
Is it only a series of neurosignals, and
at some

45
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,180
point these neurosignals amount that of
things trigger a sort

46
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,410
of thing called consciousness where,
whereby we think that.

47
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,250
We take a decision, but the decision in
fact

48
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,270
was already taken by the signal, by the
neurons.

49
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:12,170
Well, things are not that bad because
Libet

50
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:16,020
has also done some other observations, in
particular while

51
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,980
doing his observations he also noticed
that there are

52
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,970
signals of a different type, of this
particular type.

53
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:22,190
And then

54
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,880
he asked the subject to say what happens,
what feeling did he

55
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,290
or she have in the brain when these kind
of signals were observed.

56
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,610
And what the subjects said is that in
those cases, they had

57
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:40,040
felt like moving the finger, but then they
had changed their mind.

58
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:46,370
So it seems that our consciousness is not
the same at all as our mental states.

59
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,470
On the one hand, the mental

60
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,430
states influences the consciousness and
tries to take a

61
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,190
decision, but the consciousness is somehow
free to say, no.

62
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,790
Of course, this is very rapidly said, and
I am summarizing at a very

63
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,260
phenomenological level a lot of
discussions, and

64
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,690
some people may not even agree with this.

65
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,340
Conclusion in fact there is a lot of

66
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,910
debate about the real meaning of Libet's
experiment.

67
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,580
Let me mention a few

68
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,130
comments that I have sorted out from
internet but

69
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,650
you can find many others if you google for
it.

70
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,790
Some people have criticized the original
experiments by the

71
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,020
fact these critical of saying where you
have seen the

72
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,130
dot when you have taken a concscious
decision is

73
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,000
not very precise and it is indeed it is
not.

74
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,310
Also because there is a lag from the eye
to the brain.

75
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,290
Now I have to instead of criticizing
there,

76
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,000
I have to say that I would praise Libet

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,450
for coming up with such a simple
arrangement, just put

78
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,970
a clock on the wall and ask the person to
look.

79
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,080
This smart idea triggered the whole
debate.

80
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,640
And this has also let to later.

81
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,770
Do more precise experiments with more
direct measurements and let us

82
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:59,550
confirm in fact the initial observation,
with some difference in the times.

83
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,440
Another objection is that the task

84
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,740
of pushing a button that has no
consequence at

85
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,830
all other than pushing the button is not
particulary meaningful.

86
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,100
Recently, some experiments have tried to
address more meaningful tasks.

87
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,450
It's always about pushing buttons, but now
there are two buttons,

88
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,790
and well, nothing really bad happens if
you push those buttons, but

89
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,430
the goal is rather to try to guess what
another person

90
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,620
is doing and if you guess correctly then
you get some reward.

91
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,510
So there is a little bit

92
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,470
of meaning there.

93
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,320
Again, it is not exactly what we would
call a very strong moral decision.

94
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,540
But the conclusion I want to say is that,
no fundamental discrepancy

95
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:44,580
from Libet's findings have been observed,
even with much more refined experiments.

96
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,460
Of course, many people are also discussing
whether this very simple description

97
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,030
with a consciousness, the mental state,
and the finger moving, is enough.

98
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:53,570
There are probably

99
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,680
many more physical and neuronal processes
in between.

100
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,740
And again, these are, goes far beyond the
course of this course.

101
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,090
I hope that at least your curiosity has
been

102
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,870
triggered to look a bit more into these
topics.

103
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,920
So let's throw a balance of what we have
seen from this little experiment.

104
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,500
The first observation is that mental
states and consciousness

105
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,220
are not identical, and in particular, it
is not obvious

106
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,740
at all that consciousness is just an
emergent phenomenon of the mental states.

107
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,460
There are lots of debates there, there are
many serious

108
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,250
people who maintain such a position, but
many others who don't.

109
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,016
And again, it's an exciting debate worth
following.

110
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:35,900
But clearly, Libet's experiment shows that
there are some

111
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,860
physical mechanisms in the brain that bias
our decisions.

112
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,300
At some point, if I may put it like this,
the brain sends a message saying,

113
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,810
hey, please, push that button.

114
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,379
But apparently, we can also tell the
brain, no, sorry, I don't do it now.

115
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,160
This is not particularly astonishing.

116
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,050
We started this lecture by stating that

117
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,390
freewill does not mean complete lack of
determination.

118
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,820
And I repeated these tests are always

119
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,140
done so far in simple and controlled
situations.

120
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,390
The very meaningful decisions of our life
cannot be brought back to

121
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,790
this kind of tests.

122
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,780
For instance, if you think of a decision
to this but is

123
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:19,580
not very, is not a moral problem sometimes
but have very important implications.

124
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:24,380
And we think we take it freely, namely the
decision to marry someone.

125
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,770
Well, that decision is not taken half a
second before proposing.

126
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:34,400
It's a result of a lot of processes, a lot
of deliberations and reflection and so on.

127
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,030
Certainly these kind of decisions and
other complicated moral

128
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,350
decisions are not captured by these kind
of experiments.

129
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,550
They are nonetheless extremely relevant,
and it's worthwhile, again,

130
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,860
following, at least, to see what the
future will reveal.

131
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,250
So we've come to the end of the lecture
eight, in which I

132
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,660
try to highlight the connections and the

133
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,510
differences between randomness,
indeterminism and free will.

134
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,530
We've seen that free will is not
randomness.

135
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,820
Neither it is total lack of determinism.

136
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,900
It is the possibility of shaping our
choices.

137
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,870
Limited maybe, and it relates to our
responsibility.

138
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,110
We'll discuss the important notion of
measurement independence; that is

139
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,060
one of the conditions for scientific
method to be possible.

140
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,510
We've mentioned the science of the brain,
very, very rapidly of course.

141
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:26,270
But mostly to mention, that in my opinion
and the opinion of many people,

142
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,130
complexicity is a much more relevant
notion then

143
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:33,370
quantum determination when it comes to the
brain.

144
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,080
And finally we have seen Libet's
experiment.

145
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,700
Now, I'm sorry, I'm very bad at
conclusions, so

146
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,900
I will conclude very rapidly this series
of lectures.

147
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,420
Now you should be able to talk about
randomness, the

148
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:52,490
fact that randomness is useful, how to
define and quantify randomness.

149
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,870
You should have some idea how to generate
randomness.

150
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,290
You should be able to speak, also, about

151
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:04,150
physical determinism and indeterminism,
predictability, chaos, all these notions.

152
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,630
You have a little bit of notions of free
will,

153
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,480
at least insofar as free will relates to
the previous topics.
