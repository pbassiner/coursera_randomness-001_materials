So here we are.
We have reached the end of these lectures.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,360
I hope you enjoyed the topic of randomness
and the other topics that we dealt with.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,560
I also hope that your curiosity has been
triggered

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,160
and you're going to continue exploring
these exciting fields.

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,676
I just want to finish by thanking my two
teaching assistants.

6
00:00:19,676 --> 00:00:24,350
Melvin and [UNKNOWN] have done a fantastic
job in

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,550
the preparation of the lectures as well as
in managing

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,060
the forum.

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,240
And now again, thank to all of you for
[UNKNOWN] now and good luck for the rest.
