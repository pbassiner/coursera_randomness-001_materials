1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,290
Welcome to this last lecture of this

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,170
course on randomness chance, and free
will.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,050
It's time to speak a little bit about free
will.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,570
Of course not in an exhaustive way.

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,110
Just some ideas to trigger your curiosity
and to

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,060
link to what we have seen in the previous
lectures.

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,210
So here is the plan.

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,790
My main goal being, as I just

9
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:26,970
announced to discuss some connections
between randomness,

10
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,530
physical determinism, indeterminism, and
free will.

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,020
There will be four segments in this
lecture.

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,270
The first one will be a tentative

13
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,240
definition of free will, getting some
ideas.

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,300
In the second, we will discuss the
relation

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,000
between free will and the practice of
science.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,790
Science is something that the human being
does, and as such does

17
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:52,040
reflect that the human being has free will
and influence on the possibility

18
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,540
of science.

19
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,220
Then I will sketch some quick notes on the
brain, by far not exhaustive.

20
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,900
It is not going to be, is not going

21
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,890
to be a course on neurosciences in any
possible meaning.

22
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:09,540
And finally we will finish with Libet's
experiment that is, the

23
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,730
traditional experiment that started
inquiring about free will in a sense.

24
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,350
So let us start with a definition,

25
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,320
what is free will?

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,890
Before defining free will I, two reminders
of

27
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,000
two notions we defined in the previous
lectures.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,670
One is randomness of course.
We spent a lot of time discussing this.

29
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,600
Randomness is essentially
unpredictability.

30
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,030
It's a very neutral notion, because we

31
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,970
can just specify for whom something is
unpredictable.

32
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:42,260
For that person or for that physical
process.

33
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:48,110
The unpredictable events are random.
Then we spoke of physical determinism.

34
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,970
This is the question of whether all that
happens in

35
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:55,320
the physical world is predetermined, and
we have seen that whatever

36
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,770
your view of, ultimate view of the
universe is,

37
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:06,220
not everything is predictable for someone
that acts only in our universe.

38
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,510
Even if this being has

39
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,010
unlimited computational power, quantum
phenomena are

40
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:14,210
intrinsically unpredictable at some point,
and

41
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:19,290
in particular, if, also, we have limited
computational power, like all of us.

42
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,810
Also some classical phenomenon can be too
complex, or even, simple one,

43
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,900
deterministic, can be hard to predict,

44
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,540
because of susceptibility to initial
conditions.

45
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,700
That's what we have seen in some of the
previous lectures.

46
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,840
Now, when it comes to free will, I

47
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,390
want to take a definition from experience,
because, again,

48
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,830
I don't have time to enter into all

49
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,690
the philosophical debates on how to define
Free will.

50
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,480
So our experience tells us that what we
call free will,

51
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,050
is the capacity of making some choices
that are not completely pre-determined.

52
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,470
In this course I will argue from the point
of view that

53
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,840
any definition or any presentation of free
will must try to capture this

54
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,250
experience, because this is what we want
to describe at the end of the day.

55
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,030
Why human beings have this feeling of
being capable of choices.

56
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,360
It has an unquestionable relevance for our
lives

57
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,830
at the, of course, the level of moral
responsibility.

58
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:17,940
And it's impossible to keep the discussion
of free will fully separated from my

59
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,620
or your Weltanschaaung, your view of the
world, because it touches on,

60
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,660
what is a human being?

61
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,410
It touches on the meaning or lack of
meaning of our lives.

62
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,960
So depending what are your positions in
life

63
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,680
you may have a different attitude to
freewill.

64
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,610
And we have to remember that very often in
human

65
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:44,680
activity all these notions and beliefs of
servitude are very entangled.

66
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,880
We cannot just do a bare scientific
analysis, and then after that,

67
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,320
shatter all our convictions.

68
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,350
We are going to see these, especially in,
when it

69
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,070
comes to the practice of science in the,
the, second segment.

70
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,240
Needless to say a proper introduction of

71
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,100
all the notions, debates, people,
philosophers, scientists,

72
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,570
and so on, would take a full course, and
we don't have time for that.

73
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,710
This will be just an appetizer to trigger
your curiosity, as I said before.

74
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:12,400
Something of the ratio between freewill
and randomness.

75
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,630
My own choices are unpredictable

76
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,140
for someone who does not know me.

77
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,880
So if you don't know me and you see me
somewhere thinking about more choice.

78
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,670
You can use that as a random number
generator.

79
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,360
It's not going to be very fast because
nobody of us

80
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,440
takes more choices every micro second, but
it could possibly be done.

81
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,000
However it's clear that I do not make my
choices by tossing a coin.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,540
So what determines a moral choice?

83
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,010
A choice of mine.

84
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,600
A choice of performing some action.

85
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,318
At a very phenomenological level, we

86
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:50,530
can speak of three constituents, some
predispositions.

87
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:55,240
The immediate circumstances and then my
judgement or my decision to act.

88
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,980
The predispositions can be of types.
Again it's very phenomenological.

89
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,720
People who have a given theory may have
different

90
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,220
opinion how these notions are related but
clearly at

91
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,310
the basic level, we can discuss of Somatic
predisposition, something that

92
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,550
is in our body, and formation, the
formation that we received.

93
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,130
Of course, the formation we received
partly shaped our brain,

94
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,400
you know, so it's not, the two are not
completely uncorrelated.

95
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,220
But, okay, clearly there is a difference.

96
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,880
Now, this is what is in my control or not.

97
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,680
The somatic predisposition clearly not in
my control.

98
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,800
If something

99
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,140
is influenced by my genetic code, I can't
do anything for it.

100
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:39,900
The formation and immediate circumstances
are partly my control, though not fully.

101
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,320
For instance formation, clearly if someone
chooses to be formed in a terrorist

102
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:51,110
camp, his or her future actions may be
influenced by this choice.

103
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,300
And this part of the formation, the choice
for

104
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,240
being formed in a terrorist camp rather
than in

105
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,510
a school or in any other environment, is
partly,

106
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,080
at least, normal, in the control of the
subject.

107
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,860
No, nobody is obliged, alright?

108
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,020
As we know, life is complex, but nobody's

109
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,500
really obliged to take these kind of
decisions.

110
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,420
Similarly the immediate circumstances is
clearly if I go

111
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,210
to a place where I know it's, I'm going to

112
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,190
be like to do something nasty because I'm
going

113
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,670
to meet people that I don't like, I'm
angry with.

114
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,400
I can get mad

115
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,600
at them.
Maybe I can also choose not to go.

116
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,030
Then once I am there, I, maybe I'm not any
longer

117
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,120
too much in control of my actions when I
see these people.

118
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,750
Finally, there is this part that I wrote

119
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,720
there, my judgment and the decision to
act.

120
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,470
That is the part where we're believed to
be fully in control,

121
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,360
that's the component of the action where
we have something to say.

122
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,100
Of course, various philosophies of action
differ on

123
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,380
the values and the relative importance of
these factors.

124
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,800
Some may even deny some of these factors.

125
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,710
Now let me illustrate these with a very
famous story from the western culture.

126
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,420
It's in fact from the Christian leaders

127
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,500
tradition, it's the famous denial of
Peter.

128
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:05,700
You may know that Peter is the, one of the
disciples of Jesus and one of the, in fact

129
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:10,990
the one that Jesus has chosen to be the
leader after he would go away.

130
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:18,620
So on a fateful day, the famous day of the
Last Supper, around 6 p.m.

131
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,520
During the Supper, Jesus announced that
He's going to die, and Peter says very

132
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,860
clearly, Lord, I am prepared to go to
prison and to die with You.

133
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,510
That's his moral decision, that's what he
would like to do.

134
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,980
A few hours later, I put 9 p.m just to
have

135
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:38,070
a, sort of, time framework, Jesus is being
captured by his enemies.

136
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,500
And Peter indeed starts fighting for him,
until Jesus

137
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,180
tells him to stop because he doesn't want
to fight.

138
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:48,330
In a few hours later, or less, midnight,
Jesus is being interrogated somewhere,

139
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:52,790
Peter is waiting outside to see what is
going to happen to his master.

140
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,740
And a maidservant sees him there in the
courtyard,

141
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,030
some unknown fellow that she has never met
before.

142
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,920
And she inquires if he's a disciple of
Jesus,

143
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,090
without maybe too bad intention.

144
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,610
And Peter tired, scared by the
consequences that can

145
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,880
be he immediately replies, woman, I do not
know him.

146
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,700
And then later, he denies Him two more
times.

147
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,940
So we see here a very interesting
experience that,

148
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,420
maybe we have felt, some of us, many times
also.

149
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,430
That's what Peter wanted to do.

150
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,840
He wanted to be strong, to go to prison
and to die with Jesus.

151
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,890
And that's what ends up doing.

152
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,730
Because of tiredness, because he was at

153
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,590
the wrong place, because whatever had
happened

154
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:40,340
to him, he ended up a few hours later just
denying even to know Him.

155
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,010
I brought up this story just to show that
it's known

156
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:48,110
to humanity that we're only in partial
control of our actions.

157
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,970
So let us make a balance of elements here
what free will is not.

158
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,380
Free will is not the possibility of
completely unpredictable behavior.

159
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,130
Normally, we call this, to lose one's
head,

160
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:05,140
if someone does something unfortunate or
something bad that

161
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,450
was completely unpredictable, and all the
neighbours and

162
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,380
friends say it was unbelievable of him or
her.

163
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,900
Well, then, normally, this means, to lose
one's

164
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,940
head, not to take a more responsible
decision.

165
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,390
Free will is also not the denial that

166
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,320
somatic or external factors may influence
our choices, as

167
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,820
we have just seen in the story of Peter.

168
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,960
This is not what is meant by free will.

169
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,700
It would be stupid to deny that our
genetic constitution,

170
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,009
that our external circumstances, and so
on, do influence our choice.

171
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,210
Free will is what, is the capacity of
making choices

172
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:42,460
that are not fully determined, and the,
the ensuing responsibility.

173
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,520
The people that did not, maybe strong way.

174
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,110
Whatever your philosophy is, if your
philosophy reaches the conclusion

175
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,780
that Hitler has done nothing wrong, you'd
better think again.

176
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,130
Such a conclusion would be abhorrent.

177
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,130
So somehow Hitler was responsible.

178
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:02,320
And of course not only such a terrible
case, but somehow

179
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,840
we are responsible for our moral
decisions, in one way or another.

180
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,730
Now I'm not going to continue on the
general

181
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,360
philosophical moral theoretical question.

182
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,490
I'm going to focus the next segements on
what has science to say about this.
