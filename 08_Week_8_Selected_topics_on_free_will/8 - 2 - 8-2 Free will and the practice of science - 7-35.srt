1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:06,530
Now we are going to consider the role of
free will in the practice of science.

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,110
Science being a human activity.

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,310
One may ask whether the free will of
humans plays

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:16,230
a role in the practice or even the
possibility of science.

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,420
I want to spend most of the

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,210
time explaining a notion that is extremely
important.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,660
It is called measurement independence.

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,920
This is a fundamental tenet of the
scientific method,

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,230
and it is the possibility that the
experimenter performs

10
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,400
different measurements, or the possibility
of changing only some parameters.

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,769
Let me illustrate what I mean by a few
examples.

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,710
In lecture four, for instance, we have
seen in the lab

13
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,000
that the student was changing only the
value of the resistor.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,430
Temperature, and the bandwidth, and all
possible

15
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:56,330
other relevant parameters being kept
unchanged.

16
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:59,050
Now, imagine that this is not possible.

17
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,150
Imagine that by changing the value of the
resistor,

18
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:04,810
one also changes the temperature, one also
changes the frequency.

19
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,120
One also chances, in fact, the whole
configuration.

20
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:13,300
Then it would be impossible to perform an
experiment and check that the noise is low

21
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,020
that we wrote down, that the square of

22
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,590
the noise, of the voltage is proportional
to the

23
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,020
resistor, is in fact true.

24
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,590
A similar example if you want to measure

25
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,080
gravity, very trivial, you have to try for
instance

26
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,790
one ways, one way of doing it is to

27
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,576
try and drop the same mass from different
heights.

28
00:01:29,576 --> 00:01:34,140
Now we making that the stone that you have
in your hands conspires against you

29
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,500
to change its properties when you go to a
different place to throw it down.

30
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,560
Then again, it will make sense to check
the law of gravity.

31
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,030
You are to assume that the story is the

32
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,970
same, you are just testing it in different
situations.

33
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,210
Another very important procedure that you
certainly know, calibration.

34
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,860
When you calibrate a measurement device,
what you do is to see

35
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,040
what is happening at the detection before
you put the sample into it.

36
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,850
So that once you put the sample, the
difference between what you are

37
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,340
seeing before and what you see now, is
presumably due to the sample.

38
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,280
Again, if it's due to a conspiracy that
the device behaves differently whether

39
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,310
it knows that there is a sample or not
there, then science becomes impossible.

40
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,000
Last example, I think by now you
understand

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,520
what I'm speaking about, but if you think

42
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,020
of drug tests, same, you have to give

43
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,670
the same drug to persons with various
conditions.

44
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:34,950
And again, if the drug knows, whatever
that means, that the person it

45
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,700
is going to be eaten by has a

46
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,850
given condition, behaves differently
according to this knowledge.

47
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:42,870
Then the test doesn't make any sense.

48
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,180
So, the whole possibility of science,
relies on the fact that, you, try to

49
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:53,010
keep all the other meaningful parameters
unchanged, and you just change one or two.

50
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,330
This has little to do with morality, with
consciousness, but

51
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,580
it says that there must be some events
that are uncorrelated.

52
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,900
There's some events that do not depend on
each other.

53
00:03:05,316 --> 00:03:08,655
In the theater, theater of conspiracy I
defined at the beginning of lecture

54
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:12,690
five, also science becomes pointless,
like, probably

55
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,000
most of the rest of our lives.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,660
Now let us see what is these, an example
of this independent chain of events.

57
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,090
So, in order to do science, the science of
measuring my resistor.

58
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,650
I have to start by assuming

59
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,530
that there is no initial correlation
between

60
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,340
myself, my mental state and the resistor.

61
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,150
That the resistor doesn't know that I'm
going to measure it and that I

62
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,870
have now chosen our resistors specifically
fabricated

63
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,650
for me to show a particular behavior.

64
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,660
So, at the beginning, there is a resistor.

65
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,520
They are living its own life, fluctuating
its own way, and

66
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,470
there is myself, thinking that maybe I
should do some experiment.

67
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:51,720
A later

68
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,180
time, still no correlation, I decide to
make a measurement of the thermal

69
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,660
noise of the resistor, and my resistor is
still perfectly independent of me.

70
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,680
Now comes the dependence.

71
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,910
This is the measurement, the interaction
between the physical

72
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,600
object and what I know, and I get some
knowledge.

73
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,740
Now there is correlation, in the sense
that

74
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,990
my mental state has some information about
the

75
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,920
fluctuations of voltage in the resistor.

76
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:24,584
Now you may think, well what guarantee is
this?

77
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:27,495
Because at the, at the beginning maybe
there was

78
00:04:27,495 --> 00:04:31,045
some event, let's call it the Big Bang,
that created

79
00:04:31,045 --> 00:04:35,518
some correlations so maybe it's impossible
to have physical processes,

80
00:04:35,518 --> 00:04:39,399
my mental state and the resistor that are
really independent.

81
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,430
Now even physics, without or

82
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,430
yet invoking freewill has a good answer to
that question.

83
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,350
So, assume that indeed there was an
initial Big

84
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,930
Bang or whatever event, such that in fact
the atoms

85
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,550
that now compose the resistors and the
atom that now

86
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,720
compose my brain, have interacted in a way
or another.

87
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,590
The resistor on myself, I'm not the only
physical object present in this universe.

88
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,610
Both have, we have interacted with plenty
of other things.

89
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,190
All these small explosions represent
collisions in the

90
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,980
sense of exchange of information between
different systems.

91
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,040
So, even staying at the classical level.

92
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,230
If I have shared my information and also
the resistor, I shared its

93
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,630
information with many other events, and
these

94
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,320
events now have disappeared from the
scene.

95
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,230
You see that the arrows point outwards.

96
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,880
I don't control them.
I don't know where they are.

97
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,180
Then, in practice,

98
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,248
it's as if the resistor and myself would
be uncorrelated.

99
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:43,770
Because the initial may be strongly shared
information, has

100
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,410
been diluted into all these possible
degrees of freedom.

101
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,900
So for all practical purposes it's as if
we had no, no common past.

102
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,628
Moreover, remember that there is not

103
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:55,900
only classical physics, there's quantum
physics.

104
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,890
There maybe have been, and there have
been, quantum

105
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,710
events on all these causal chains, which
are really creation

106
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,340
of information.

107
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,640
So we see that physics itself, within
physics itself, within science,

108
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,590
within physical processes in the universe,
we have good reasons to believe,

109
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:15,010
to accept, that at the beginning of the
experiment, the resistor and

110
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,940
my mental state are not correlated, do not
depend on each other.

111
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,460
So, let me go back now to the question
with

112
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,859
which I started, is free will needed to do
science?

113
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,470
As we've just seen the scientific method
itself requires measurement independence.

114
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,570
Free will is not strictly needed.

115
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,980
We can justify measurement independence in
a

116
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,880
sort of deterministic of purely material
physical universe.

117
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:44,550
Of course, if we accept from all kind of
other evidence that there is free

118
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,810
will, then some measurement independence
comes for

119
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,260
free, especially the measurement
independence where really I,

120
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:56,100
a human being, is involved in making a
measurement.

121
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,490
There is another topic that I have not
brought up,

122
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,334
and I don't want to spend much time on it
now.

123
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:04,720
It would deserve also a full course.

124
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,790
Is the moral responsibility of the
scientist.

125
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,480
Let me just put it like this, if you have
a

126
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:16,620
favorite, favorite ethics theory of
behavior, that denies free will to

127
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,900
the point of approving cheating, bullying
in the workplace, falsification

128
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,150
of data, and so on.
Then I think you should think again

129
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:32,870
because these behaviors are universally
acknowledged as unacceptable.
