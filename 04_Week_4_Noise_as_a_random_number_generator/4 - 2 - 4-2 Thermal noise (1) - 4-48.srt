1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,550
So after this short introduction on the
notion of noise abstractly let us consider

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,610
a particular case of noise which is the
case of thermal noise over a resistor.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,690
So here is our resistor.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,690
A very simple electric circuit that you

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,020
will certainly recognize from very basic
physics.

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,470
there is a current generator.
And a resister.

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,100
And as we all know the voltage drop across
the

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,270
resister is just given by the value of the
resistance

9
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,750
times the value of the current.
Now, if I would remove the source of

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:39,250
current, you would infer that the voltage
measured across the resistor is just 0.

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,250
But is it really zero?

12
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,230
In fact the resistor is in contact with a

13
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,370
thermal bath, so if we look into the
resistor,

14
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,900
which is in fact a piece of metal with

15
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,480
some characteristics, there are electrons
that are those who carry

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,320
the current normally.

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,450
Even if there is no current being enforced
on them.

18
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,500
They will feel the thermal excitations and

19
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,900
they will move at random in various
directions.

20
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,400
Each electron changing very frequently
because of collision

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,720
sources, because another kind of
excitation arrives on it.

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,910
So, in these particular configurations,
for instance, there is

23
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,730
a net current going upwards, at least a
current

24
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:17,920
of electrons going upwards.

25
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,930
So let's say that by convention the
voltage is positive.

26
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,500
Some time later, the speed of the
electrons has

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,620
changed and so now we have a different
voltage.

28
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:31,240
And so on, across the time because of
thermal fluctuations, the speed of the

29
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,530
electrons changes constantly and as a
result

30
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,179
the net voltage across the resistor also
changes.

31
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:41,850
What we are learning here is that the
famous formula V

32
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,840
equal R times I gives only the average
voltage.

33
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,110
And this is indeed 0.

34
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,990
But there are thermal fluctuations to the
voltage.

35
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,890
And these are the fluctuations we are

36
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,010
going to use in order to generate
randomness.

37
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,300
This noise is called Johnson-Nyquist
noise.

38
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,620
From the name of John Johnson, who first
reported it and Harry Nyquist, one

39
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,600
of his colleagues at Bell Labs, who

40
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,550
did the theoretical description for the
first time.

41
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:07,680
In

42
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,506
Johnson's paper we find the description of
how this noise behaves.

43
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:18,310
The mean-square potential fluctuation, so
the fluctuation square.

44
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,030
Over the conductor, over the resistor in
this case, is proportional

45
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,730
to the electrical resistance and the
absolute temperature of the conductor.

46
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,460
It is independent of the size, shape or
material of the conductor.

47
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,990
In other words, the square of the voltage

48
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:38,050
fluctuations is proportional to the
resistance times the temperature.

49
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,040
Let us try to derive this formula.

50
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:46,080
We probably know all from basic physics
that the power dissipated

51
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,540
by a resistor is the voltage squared
divided by twice the resistance.

52
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,770
You may also remember that, when it comes
to thermal fluctuations there

53
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:59,070
is always a KB times T appearing, where K
is Boltzmann's constant.

54
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,010
In fact the power of thermal fluctuations,
in this

55
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,910
case is given by the formula there, where
delta

56
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,870
f is the bandwidth of the receiver,
essentially it

57
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,830
means how many frequencies we detect
without a voltmeter.

58
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,170
And the two come from the fact that the
cable is a one

59
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,125
dimensional wave guide for electric and
magnetic field and these leads to a

60
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:21,400
dis-factor of two for reasons that a bit
too complicated to explain in

61
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,130
general but would be explained for those
who are interested in the next slide.

62
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,200
The formula for Johnson Niquist noise
comes by just

63
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,240
equating these two powers that must be
equal to equilibrium.

64
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,035
And we get that the square of the voltage
fluctuations is equal to

65
00:03:37,035 --> 00:03:42,520
4 times k by, k B times T times R times
the bandwidth.

66
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,930
Here is a more rigorous derivation and
some more notes

67
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,220
for those who are interested but I will
not stop here.

68
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,240
Let me just put this predictions

69
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,390
in graph.
So, though it's pretty obvious.

70
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,320
So here is the clearly the graph.

71
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,280
If I plot the voltage fluctuations, as a
function of the resistor is a, square

72
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,960
of the voltage evacuation as a function of
the resistor is clearly a straight line.

73
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,230
Let us put some numbers there.

74
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:10,390
If I take one kilo-ohm of resistor, and at
room temperature and for a

75
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:15,620
bandwidth of ten kilohertz, the
fluctuations that we observe should

76
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,450
be of the order of 0.5 microvolts is very
little.

77
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,420
We will need, we will need probably an
amplifier to see them.

78
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,940
But another point I want to stress because
we are going to see

79
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,860
it as well in the lab, is that the
frequency spectrum is flat.

80
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,160
Essentially for, for the relevant

81
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,020
frequencies, all the frequencies are
present.

82
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,750
Remember that previously we're discussing
these frequencies spectrum, and

83
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,890
saying that the broader the frequency
spectrum, the more noise

84
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,550
is there.
Well, here we have a very flat spectrum.

85
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,880
So we expect a lot of noise from these
fluctuations.
