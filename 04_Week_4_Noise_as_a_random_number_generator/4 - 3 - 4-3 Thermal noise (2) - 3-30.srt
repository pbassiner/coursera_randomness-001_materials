00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,290
After this introduction and these
theoretical explanations we are going

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,360
to observe thermal noise of a resistor in
the lab.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,470
Before leaving the work to one of the
students here we demonstrate this

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:18,360
noise, I want to sketch rapidly what kind
of electronics is being used.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,540
Remember that we want to detect voltage
fluctuations

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,490
that are in the order of half a microvolt.

7
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,900
This is normally

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,070
too weak to be detected directly, so an
amplifier

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,010
will be needed before sending the signal
to the oscilloscope.

10
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,460
The oscilloscope is a very routine device
in

11
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,120
a lab, for those who would not be
familiar.

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,560
Is essentially a signal analyser that can
block in

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,110
a real time, in this case the voltage
fluctuations.

14
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:52,550
So we are going to see how the resistor
produces indeed these

15
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,070
noise in a real time.

16
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,120
Now it's time to go to the lab and I leave
the string to

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,998
one of our students each and who is going
to demonstrate to determine noise.

18
00:01:02,998 --> 00:01:06,970
>> Hi, I'm Ichen and today I'm about to

19
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,800
bring you a little visualization of this
Johnson noise.

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,010
So the Johnson noise is generated by a

21
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,760
resister, which is our little blue thing
here.

22
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,710
The good thing about this

23
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,580
one is that it's a variable resister,
allowing me

24
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,900
to change its resistance by tuning it with
a screwdriver.

25
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,800
But as you probably know that just a noise
at room temperature is simply too weak to

26
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,040
be directly measured so this is where an

27
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,010
amplifier comes in which is the gold box
here.

28
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:43,092
The amplifier receives the signal and
amplify it, output it to

29
00:01:43,092 --> 00:01:43,600
an acidisco.

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,200
And it is on the acidisco that the signal

31
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,710
will be measured and displayed live on the
screen.

32
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,070
So now you probably don't see much here
because the

33
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,600
resistance now is zero and there's nothing
generating the Johnson noise,

34
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,890
but now I'm going to turn the resistance
to some

35
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,200
higher value and you may observe what's
changing on the screen.

36
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,390
So now we are at 0 ounce, and

37
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,650
I'm increasing the resistance and here we

38
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,158
are starting to have something oscillating
on screen.

39
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,890
Increasing it to a higher value.

40
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:22,350
And you can see the noise signal is much,
much stronger.

41
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,570
And now I'm going to the reverse.
Turning the resistance back to 0.

42
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,070
And

43
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:39,980
as you can see, the same thing happens as
the resistance decreases.

44
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,580
The signal amplitude also decreases.

45
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,340
And eventually leaves nothing on the
screen.

46
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:53,660
>> And we are back now so you have seen
now, how indeed,

47
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:58,590
changing the resistance changes the noise.
I want to finish on a comment, namely,

48
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:02,490
do these fluctuations obey the law that we
have seen.

49
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,677
Here is the result.

50
00:03:05,677 --> 00:03:10,420
Ichen measured the five points in red, and
the

51
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,480
blue line is the theoretical curve that we
established before.

52
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,008
As you see, indeed, we can satisfy that,
we can be confident that

53
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:23,753
the noise that has been observed is indeed
the thermal noise of our resistor,

54
00:03:23,753 --> 00:03:25,670
we are not picking up.

55
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,730
A different kind of knowledge, some other
sources of knowledge that will be around.
