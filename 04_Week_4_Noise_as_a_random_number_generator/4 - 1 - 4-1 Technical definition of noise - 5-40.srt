1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,350
Hell, welcome lecture number four.
This will be a short lecture.

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,070
In which we are going to describe how
physical

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,530
noise can be used as a random number
generator.

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,020
This lecture in a sense, is a transition
between

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,790
the lectures on generation on randomness
needs characterization that

6
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,270
we had before, and the series of lectures
on

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,774
physical randomness that would be number
five, six, and seven.

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,730
The plan of the lecture is as follows.

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,590
In the first segment, I'm going to
describe the

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,500
technical mathematical definition of what
is meant by noise.

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,940
The next two segments will be devoted to
an example of thermal noise using an

12
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:45,510
electrical resistor, and we will first do
some theory and then go to the lab

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:51,200
this time to see the phenomenon live.
And finally, the fourth segment is devoted

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,840
to help extract randomness from a signal
like the one of the thermal noise.

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,160
So, let us start with the mathematics of
noise.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,830
The crucial idea is that noise is
equivalent to many frequences.

17
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:09,280
Let me introduce the famous motion of
frequency spectrum.

18
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:17,040
So here you have a very simple plot of the
curve y equal to sinus omega t.

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,670
I plotted it for the value of omega equal
to 1.

20
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,010
Just a normal sin function.

21
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:26,270
So in this sinusoidal function there is
one frequency which is omega.

22
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,540
Or, okay, sometimes is, the, typically the
frequency is rather omega divided by 2

23
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,270
pi, but, okay, I will use this abuse of
language call it also omega frequency.

24
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,700
So if I plot on a graph, the spectrum,
meaning

25
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,210
where are the frequencies, I would get
that there's only one

26
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,620
frequency at omega equal to 1.
Here are two other curves.

27
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,080
The black and the red one.

28
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,340
The black one is the curve sinus omega t
plus sinus twice omega t.

29
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,720
So there are two frequencies now.

30
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,640
Omega and 2 omega.
With the same amplitude.

31
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,790
The right curve is Sin wt omega t plus one
half times sin wt 2 omega t.

32
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,620
So the, again two frequencies,

33
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,610
one of them has larger amplitude than the
other.

34
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,800
And now we can continue adding
frequencies.

35
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,960
So here for instance I am plotting a
particular

36
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,930
curve, which is a sum of M different
frequencies.

37
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,170
All in the form of cosine omega times t.

38
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,730
If you know signals and waves or other
signal phenomena, you know that

39
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,950
here I could also add in principal of
phase so I could have written

40
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:38,970
here cross omega t plus phi but let's put
all the phi's equal to zero.

41
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:45,470
So here, the first graph that I'm showing
you is a plot of a sum of 10 such cosines.

42
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,247
The frequencies are done at random with
MatLab.

43
00:02:48,247 --> 00:02:52,740
More or less according to the spectrum
shown here on the right.

44
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,390
So here all the frequency will have the
same

45
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,580
amplitude in this example, 1 over 10 in
this case.

46
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,090
And there

47
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,250
are ten particular frequencies.

48
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,640
The numbers are not important, and we see

49
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,250
already that the signal looks more noisy
than before.

50
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,790
Now if I add more frequencies, like for
instance I have added 40 frequencies.

51
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,620
The signal looks more and more noisy.
There less and less regularity into it.

52
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,420
So that's the main message, that more
frequency in

53
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,050
the spectrum means that the signal is more
noisy.

54
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,180
Or more precisely, what it means is that

55
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,440
there is little correlation between the
value of

56
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,330
the signal at a given time and the value
of the signal at a later time.

57
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,478
This means short memory, this means that
such a signal is hard to predict.

58
00:03:36,478 --> 00:03:40,880
Now, in many natural sources of noise,

59
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,070
like the one we're going to consider
later.

60
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:48,690
They are not discreet frequencies like the
ten or 40, or two that I use so far.

61
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,530
But the

62
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,040
possible frequency from a continuous
spectrum, and this is the

63
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,210
case that we're going to consider so, from
now on.

64
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,250
In this case it's easy, also, or
especially the spectrum

65
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,640
is sort of compact like the drawing I have
there.

66
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,890
There are not many, many peaks.

67
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,490
It's clear what is the memory time.
The memory time is just given

68
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:15,190
by the inverse of the spectral bandwidth.
So, the larger

69
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:21,370
the number of frequencies, the spectrum,
the shorter the memory time, that

70
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,210
sometimes is called correlation time or

71
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,930
coherence time depending on the physical
phenomena,

72
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:31,060
but essentially it means the time within
which the signal has some correlation,

73
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,270
the signal at time tau, still knows
something about the signal time zero.

74
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,250
But the signal at later times starts
knowing very little,

75
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,480
ultimately nothing, about the signal, the
value of the signal, times 0.

76
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,420
This is an important relation to be kept
in mind,

77
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,300
that the spectral bandwidth is the inverse
of the memory time.

78
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,450
For those who have some knowledge of
signal

79
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,590
analysis, of course this should not be
confused

80
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,700
with the relation that the length in time

81
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,010
of signal times the bandwidth is larger
than one.

82
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,540
Here, so identity is the temporal length
of the signal.

83
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,250
Can be the width

84
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,680
of a pulse, for instance.

85
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,840
Obviously, we have the relation that the
time, the memory time is smaller than the

86
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,830
identity because there cannot be any
memory once

87
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,850
the signal is completely finished, when
it's zero.

88
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,060
But, delta T can be much much larger than
Tau.

89
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,440
And that a ceiling for which delta T is
equal to Tau is called Fourier limiter.

90
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,360
This is just a remark if you have not
followed these, okay it's not

91
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,400
important for what matters.

92
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,900
What matters in the rest is the yellow
formula.

93
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,880
But it might be important for those who
have some knowledge of these topics.
