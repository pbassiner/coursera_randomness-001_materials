1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,240
Let us now consider our first example of a
random process, which will

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,970
be the typical process or the ideal
process, which is the fair coin.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,690
Here's the definition of what I'm going to
call the Fair coin.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:18,260
Fair coin is any object that can take two
values.

5
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,960
There will be labeled 0 and 1, it's called
a bit.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,580
This is the alphabet.

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,940
The alphabet is

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:30,530
binary, two values, 0 and 1, head or tail.
Up or down.

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,420
Another part of the definition of fair
coin is that each

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,852
single run, single toss of the coin must
be fully unpredictable.

11
00:00:37,852 --> 00:00:42,410
And third characteristics of the several
runs are uncorrelated.

12
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,980
What happens in the second run does not
depend on what happened in

13
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:49,100
the first, and of course, what is going to
happen in the third.

14
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,050
The fair coin, it's an ideal

15
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,450
resource for randomness.

16
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:58,850
I have to stress that it is not an
exemplary resource or universal resource,

17
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,020
is not that everything that is random can
be reduced to a fair coin.

18
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,100
And I mentioned earlier earthquakes.

19
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,850
Earthquakes cannot be modeled by fair
coins.

20
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,890
Nevertheless, it's the typical example.

21
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,030
And again as a resource, it can be the
ideal case.

22
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,300
So mathematically, the fact that a single
run

23
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,430
is truly unpredictable is translated by
fact that the probability of having zero

24
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,330
must be the same of the probability of
having one, is one half.

25
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,690
So that if you are asked to guess, if it
is

26
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,570
going to be zero or one, you really have
no clue.

27
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,360
As a consequence of the fact that

28
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,340
several answers are uncorrelated, the
probability of any

29
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,730
sequence is just the product of the

30
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,880
probability for, of the result for each
dose.

31
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,290
For each run.

32
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:46,346
And since the problem is one half all the
time, every sequence

33
00:01:46,346 --> 00:01:50,470
of n runs have probability 1 over 2 to the
power n.

34
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,490
You see an interesting relation that we'll

35
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,630
discuss later, in fact probably in lecture
three.

36
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:02,530
about between the number of runs, the
number of bits and the probability.

37
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:08,004
In this case, the you obtain the number of
bits by taking the logarithm

38
00:02:08,004 --> 00:02:11,200
in base two of the probability with a
minus sign in front.

39
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,190
This logarithm will appear many times in
the future.

40
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,090
Before continuing with the fair coin, I
want to

41
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,550
say that the alphabet is not really
creating though.

42
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,000
In the title here I have that one die is
equal

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,160
to 2.6 coins, so what is a fair die for
instance?

44
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,140
Why I am not, I am using a coin instead of
a die?

45
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,560
Well a die would change from the fair coin
just by the alphabet.

46
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,330
Now the alphabet of a die as you all know.
Has six values instead of two.

47
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,960
For the rest is the same, a single run,
that you call it

48
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,240
a cast in English, should be fully

49
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,100
unpredictable, and several runs should be
uncorrelated.

50
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:51,100
Now why I am saying that this is
essentially equivalent to a coin.

51
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,810
Okay, here are first the probabilities,
the single run, the probability of getting

52
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,360
the result one is the same as getting
results two, three, four, five,

53
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,850
six, is one over six.

54
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,360
And since there are some uncorrelated in a
sequence of n

55
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,670
runs, you get the probability 1 over 6 to
the n.

56
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,850
And now how do you get bits out of that?

57
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:16,020
Well, again you take the probability, but
instead of you take the probability,

58
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,370
the, the logarithm, sorry, in base 2 And
you get what?

59
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,630
You get that the, the number of bits is

60
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:29,440
proportional to the number of casts of the
die, times a number,

61
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,980
which is the logarithm of ba, in base 2 of
6, 2.58.

62
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:38,800
So you see that the number of bits and the
number of casts of

63
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,670
the die are essentially the same, up to a
number, up to a constant.

64
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,740
And this is a general rule.

65
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,630
So if you have an alphabet of size A, you
just get bits

66
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,780
by multiplying the number of casts, the
number of throws, the

67
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,870
number of runs, by the logarithm in base 2
of A.

68
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,756
So from now on, unless otherwise
specified,

69
00:03:59,756 --> 00:04:02,500
I will only consider coins, but bits.

70
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,420
An interesting topic is a statistics of
sequences of bits.

71
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,840
Here, imagine that you take your coin, you
toss it n times.

72
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,130
And you these as a random process that is
equivalent

73
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,570
to the following, write all possible lists
of of n bits.

74
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:28,290
Of pieces of paper put them on, in an arm,
shake the arm, and draw one at random.

75
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,690
Of course we know already that each
sequence of length n will be

76
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,610
drawn with the probability, the same
probability 1 over 2 to the n.

77
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,290
And see what can happen in this, in this
particular statistical process.

78
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,750
In the end, there is only one sequence
that consists of all zeros.

79
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:54,128
So, the probability of getting all zeros
is just 1 over 2 to the n.

80
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,280
In the end,

81
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,880
there are n sequences.

82
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,810
Where they're at least 1, 1, and n minus 1
zeros.

83
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,960
So the probability of seeing 1, 1, and n
minus

84
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,540
1 zeros is n times 1 over 2 to the n.

85
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:10,990
And so on.

86
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:17,560
So, how many sequences with the k 1s and n
minus k zeros out there, n choose k.

87
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,240
So the probability of finding n minus k 0s
and k 1s

88
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,830
is n choose k times 1, all over 2 to the
n.

89
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,470
If you study the mathematics of these
numbers, you find

90
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,280
that the sequence will be half 0s and half
1s.

91
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,470
Are the most numerals.

92
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,360
And here is the number, I've written it
there, is n, choose n over 2, which is

93
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,970
very, very close in the limit of large N
to 2 to the n, but 2 to the

94
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:52,830
n is the total number of sequences.
This means that long sequences

95
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:58,890
almost certainly, we'll have n half zeroes
and n half ones.

96
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:03,160
Of course there is still in the arm,

97
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,770
with the only sequence with all zeroes,
but essentially

98
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,225
all the sequences will have probability
one half of

99
00:06:10,225 --> 00:06:12,930
0 and one half of one, compatible with
statistics.

100
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:18,000
The next question is the statistics within
a sequence.

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,710
So now you have drawn your sequence out of
the urn.

102
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,770
And you want to see inside this sequence,
how

103
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,010
many strings of some number of beats are
there.

104
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,510
For instance, in the first line of

105
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,850
these lights, I've highlighted seven bit
strings.

106
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:39,150
There is a rule of thumb that, there was
proof I'll show in the next slide.

107
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:43,470
That essentially all the strings that are
sufficiently short should

108
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,220
appear in a sequence of length n.

109
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,720
Let's go for an example.
So let's suppose that n is only 4096.

110
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,540
How many zeroes and ones do you expect?

111
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,990
Well, you expect more or less half zeroes
and half ones.

112
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,990
And the length, these are the sequences,
the strings sorry of length one, 1 bit.

113
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:07,120
And if you do the statistics again, the
proof would be in the next line.

114
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,100
You find that indeed, you expect for a
fair coin 2084

115
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:20,700
0s, and just as many 1s, with fluctuations
of only more or less 32 units.

116
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,203
Now how many two bit sequences do you
expect?

117
00:07:23,203 --> 00:07:27,145
0001, 10 and 11?

118
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:33,301
You, again the, the calculation is simple,
you find, you would expect 512 of each,

119
00:07:33,301 --> 00:07:38,750
with fluctuation of plus or minus 20.
Again pretty clear.

120
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,040
All of them must appear, and all of them
more or less in the same number.

121
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,350
Three meets three, 170 plus or minus 12.

122
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,740
And so on.

123
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:53,360
I have the, the four bit strings, 64 plus
or minus 8 when does this stop.

124
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,083
It stops around eight.

125
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,250
The sequences of eight bits, the strings
of

126
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,160
eight bits, you expect each of one to
appear

127
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,170
twice plus or minus two.

128
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,010
It means that some of them might not
appear at

129
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:11,520
all, some of them might appear four or
maybe five times.

130
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,650
And indeed, there is a calculation that it

131
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,290
would show that my rule of thumb is
correct.

132
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,620
This is the proof of those statements.
I will not go through it.

133
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,150
If you're interested in it, pause and read
the slide.

134
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,890
Otherwise, for myself I move on.

135
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,871
Now we can state something that I like to
call the randomness dilemma.

136
00:08:33,871 --> 00:08:38,890
Take the string 00000, all 0s.

137
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:42,163
Clearly, it does not look random.

138
00:08:42,163 --> 00:08:45,090
Pick another string that I've written
there, same length.

139
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,200
It does look random.

140
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,800
Nevertheless, for a fair coin, they're
equally probable to be drawn.

141
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,300
So,

142
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,610
the question is how to define randomness.

143
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,240
We want to define randomness from the
probabilities, from the

144
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,940
statistics, because that is the
mathematical description we have of them.

145
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,740
But we see that the statistics seem to be
a

146
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,956
bit ambiguous here, the same probability
for those two sequences.

147
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:20,961
So, we want also the definition that
captures what we do believe intuitively

148
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,060
random to mean.
