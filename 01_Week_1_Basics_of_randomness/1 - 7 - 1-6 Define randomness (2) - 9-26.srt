1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,550
After having considered the definition of
the randomness of

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,150
a sequence, let us now move on to the
second

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,500
possible definition, which is to approach
a problem by

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,590
defining the randomness of the process
that produces the sequence.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,650
What is an unpredictable process?

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,550
Here is a black box.

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,530
It's producing one string of bits.

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,610
And the question I'm going to ask is can

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,010
anyone predict what is going to be the
next bit?

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:32,190
The ideal random process is such that the
probability of

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,670
the bit number n, knowing all the bits
that came before is just one half.

12
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,540
Independently of what came before.

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,500
It means again that the bit n is really
unpredictable, fully unpredictable.

14
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,330
Of course, again, here we keep the problem
that we saw

15
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,680
before, that can be very, very, very long
list of 0s.

16
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,010
The next million of bits, for instance,
may be 0s, may turn out to be 0.

17
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,580
But of course, another thing to be said is

18
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,470
that I've never seen a 1 ever in that
process.

19
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,480
I would simply not trust the process to be
random.

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,040
So I must have seen some once before and
then at least a one million

21
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,830
zero can happen although with very, very
rare probability.

22
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,830
Now it turns out for what follows that is
useful

23
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,430
to discuss the case where the boxes are
not too black.

24
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,780
I've already mentioned historical
introduction there is Kerckhoff principle,

25
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:38,190
later formulated again by Shannon, that
there shouldn't be security by obscurity.

26
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,800
Namely, that we try to get security, we
try to get

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,900
randomness, just by not revealing to the
world how our boxes work.

28
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,680
The idea being that at some point the
world

29
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,740
may discover how the box is working and if

30
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,430
we are trusting that nobody knows it while
people

31
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,410
do know it, then we are really in trouble.

32
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:00,710
So the idea is let the algorithm be known,
how

33
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,960
the box generates some random numbers, but
not a seed.

34
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,830
There is an initial seed, an initial
element of

35
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,780
secrecy of randomness that used to
generate those random numbers.

36
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,030
All these

37
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,480
notions will become clear in the lecture
two and more, even more, in lecture three.

38
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,740
But this is just to say that it's good to
move away from

39
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,510
the fully black box scenario to go to a
not too black box scenario.

40
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,090
Here's an example for instance although
it's

41
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,890
not a very practical one to generate
random.

42
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:34,850
The sequence would be drawn tfrom the
second letter of each line of a book.

43
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,240
And they don't tell you which book.

44
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,420
So you know that I'm going to take a book
from my library and generate

45
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,150
my random numbers using that book, but you
don't know which book I'm going to use.

46
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,210
The algorithm is specified but the seed,
which is the book is not.

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,120
And of course it's unpredictable if you
can't guess which book I'm going to use.

48
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,880
But if you can guess it then.

49
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,730
If you can guess the seed, then there is
no more randomness there.

50
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,966
This is what is called pseudo-randomness.

51
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:09,810
Pseudo-randomness is when even a

52
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,910
mechanical algorithm, mechanical or
mathematical,

53
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,630
I mean, it can be run by a computer is
used.

54
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,830
You can use mathematical functions, for
instance, some divider.

55
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,060
You know, it's not easy to guess a
remainder of a division.

56
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,420
And this is used sometimes to generate
randomness.

57
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,620
Again, we are going to see some examples
in the coming lectures.

58
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,500
Or what happens often in computers

59
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,350
is that you can just take the last pieces
of the clock of the computer and

60
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,620
scramble them a little bit, but in a,

61
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,420
again, the way these are scrambled is
known.

62
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,400
And what is the seed, the seed is the
precise instant, key is touched.

63
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,970
I cannot monitor my fingers to touch the
the, the, the key

64
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:55,570
at a precise moment down to microseconds.
Why is it called pseudorandomness?

65
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,640
Well, nothing is really random here, but

66
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,580
it's unpredictable for someone who does
know this.

67
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,620
Again, that's the notion of
pseudorandomness that is pretty important.

68
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,390
Now, the question you may ask is well, is
it really true what I just said?

69
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,120
Because at the end of the day, the person
outside,

70
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,410
let's say the adversary or whoever wants
to guess this

71
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,410
randomness, knows the algorithm and sees
the production of the

72
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,450
algorithm, sees the random numbers that
are coming out of that.

73
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,130
Can't you guess the seed from this
information.

74
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,880
And the answer is, most of the time, yes.
In fact the seed can be

75
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,730
inferred by observing the process.

76
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,980
So then where is the randomness.

77
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,590
Well If things are well done, this will
be, again, well defined in the

78
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,920
coming lectures, this inference, the seed
can

79
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,240
be guessed only with high computational
power.

80
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,920
So only if you are very powerful in
computing, more than anyone else, you can

81
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,910
try to extract the seed by observing the
random numbers that are being produced.

82
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,780
All, all these preparation leads me to a
very frequent

83
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,870
definition of what a random process needs.
A process is random

84
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:17,290
if it is unpredictable at least with
limited computational power.

85
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,380
And this limited computational power is
something that is used a lot.

86
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,550
We are going to see, especially lecture
two and also lecture three

87
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,690
how this notion comes in.

88
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,350
First you can have a more black box
definition.

89
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,790
You can come back to the black box
scenario and you can

90
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,670
say that the process is random if it is
predictable at all.

91
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,860
Even with unlimited computational power.

92
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,990
This would be a much stronger definition
of randomness

93
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,340
So let me finish by putting together at a
glance

94
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,770
the two definitions, the random sequence
and the random process.

95
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,380
The random sequence captures the idea of
no pattern in the sequence.

96
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,490
We don't want to have pattern in the mode
of regularities you worked with.

97
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,240
No structure there.

98
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,620
If you use only the finishing base on

99
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,600
random sequences, your sequence may not be
secret.

100
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,810
What does it mean?

101
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,250
It means that your sequence might have
been produced

102
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:20,460
years ago, copied many times and handed
over to you.

103
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,720
Many people can, can have a copy.

104
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,990
Whereas, of course, later we're going to
see, if you discuss whether

105
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,900
the process is random, then you trust the
process is producing randomness there,

106
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,440
under your eyes.
Nobody else with a copy.

107
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:38,280
In practice, the randomness of a sequence
is uncomputable

108
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,500
and you have to put a little bit of trust.

109
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,630
You have to trust a finite battery of
tests.

110
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:49,270
You do some statistical test, you check
some things and saw some of these ideas.

111
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:53,130
Like, you could check that the number of
0s and number of 1s are roughly the same.

112
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,980
The number of 00, 01, 10, 11, are roughly
the same and so on.

113
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,590
So, but you stop.
And you trust that this battery of tests

114
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:06,650
has given you enough confidence that the
sequence is behaving in a random way.

115
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:15,780
In comparison, a random process if as I
said before, if you are trusting

116
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,990
that randomness is being generated by the
process then it is secret.

117
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,850
It is random, it is there and if you keep
the

118
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,399
secrets from the adversary, then you have
it only for yourself.

119
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,470
Of course, a random process may
occasionally generate a simple sequence.

120
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,390
So, the two definitions are somehow not
always

121
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,880
tied to one another from random process.

122
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,240
As I said before, you can get a sequence
of 1 million zeros.

123
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,170
It is certainly not a random sequence,
according to

124
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,345
the, the definition of a random sequence
of multi

125
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:49,270
[INAUDIBLE].

126
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,960
In practice, also, you need some trust.

127
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,810
We need to trust the characterization,
mathematical

128
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,380
or physical of the process, of the device.

129
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,180
And with this I can summarize all that
we've learned in this first lecture.

130
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:08,700
I want you to convey various nuances of
the word unpredictable.

131
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,200
You have seen that randomness means lack
of predictability.

132
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,720
This is the main, of course, definition in
this course.

133
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:24,840
And I stressed also that the lack of the
information is not only the problem.

134
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,200
The problem is the often lack

135
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,890
of information implies lack of control, so
the

136
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,212
feeling of not being in control of what's
up.

137
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,970
The mathematical tools especially are of
course probabilities and statistics.

138
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,620
And the fair coin is the ideal case.

139
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,740
I want to repeat it here before problems
happen.

140
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,980
That the ideal case doesn't mean it is an
exemplary case, it doesn't mean

141
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,710
that all of randomness can be reduced to
the idea of a fair coin.

142
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,250
It just is the typical example we use and
the

143
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,590
one we target for in applications when
randomness is useful.

144
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,480
And finally we finish by considering
possible definitions

145
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,140
of randomness, and we wondered whether one
should

146
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,220
define the definition or that's how the
randomness

147
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,290
of a sequence or the randomness of a
process.

148
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,560
And again, something that would be
important in the future to remember is

149
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,400
that any verification of randomness
requires

150
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,410
here or there some element of trust.

151
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,480
With this we finish our first lecture,
thank you and see next time.
