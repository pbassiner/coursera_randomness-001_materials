1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,590
In the second segment, devoted to the
history of

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,910
randomness, we are moving now to the 20th
century.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,610
And I have summarized the messages of the
20th century in six of them.

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,950
And we're going to go through them one by
one.

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:20,030
The first one is probably the most
astonishing change in

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,280
the view of the world in the 20th
century's quantum physics.

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,155
We have seen that according to

8
00:00:26,155 --> 00:00:29,430
Laplace, physics was going to be fully
deterministic.

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,970
We've seen that many physicists at the
turn of the century

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:38,150
declare that physics had essentially no
future, or a future of precision.

11
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,580
In fact, things changed a lot.

12
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:45,680
already at the beginning of the century,
there were some ideas that the atomic

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,960
world would not behave according to what
the Newtonian physics would predict.

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,983
And quantum physics as we know it was
fully born in 1926.

15
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,470
For our concerns the main message of
quantum physics

16
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,590
is that there is intrinsic randomness in
elementary physics.

17
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,240
The most famous example probably is the
fact that one cannot

18
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,460
both specify position and momentum of a
particle with arbitrary precision.

19
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,100
And this is not due to a default of the
measurement,

20
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,150
is not something that is due to our
imprecision in the measurement.

21
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:27,010
It's highly that position and momentum of
not sharply-defined in nature.

22
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,900
We're going to speak a lot about these,
we'll go two lectures into it.

23
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,330
But this is the first big change in which
randomness starts playing again a role.

24
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,540
Where you would expect less, least, which
is physics.

25
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,290
The second change in the 20th century is
deterministic chaos.

26
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,560
Remember, again, the citation from Laplace
that the intellect he was speaking

27
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,090
about should be vast enough to submit all
the data to analysis.

28
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:02,180
Towards the second half of the 20th
century, we have got computers.

29
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,680
And these are perfect tool to submit a lot
of data to analysis.

30
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,790
And, here came the surprise.

31
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,210
In the 1970s, what is called the butterfly

32
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,220
effect, notice first, studied models of
the weather.

33
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,810
And what is the idea, the idea is

34
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,120
that even simple dynamics, simple
evolution in time,

35
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,590
deterministics, does no intrinsic
randomness at all, can

36
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,330
become unpredictable in practice in the
long run.

37
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,850
And this is because the dynamics is, as
they call

38
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,330
it, chaotic and it depends a lot on the
precision.

39
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,190
At which one can enter the, the figures in
a computer.

40
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,920
Again, we're going to speak during two
lectures about this topic, but

41
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,580
second point in which randomness,
unpredictability,

42
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,630
comes back in physics and in computing.

43
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,580
Third topic is chance and evolution.
this is a topic that we're not going to

44
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,870
deal with in this course.
One of the most outstanding

45
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:06,110
claims one can make is that the rise of
humans is

46
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:11,550
probably unpredictable, as far as science
goes, from the past.

47
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:17,330
So an observer in the past, may have had
really hard time predicting that we human

48
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,950
beings would appear.
And why is it so?

49
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,450
Well, because the present state of the
world, of, of the

50
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:29,480
Earth has been shaped by both macroscopic
and microscopic chance events.

51
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,440
Both these asteroids hitting the Earth,
climate changes that are hard

52
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,629
to predict, and also at the microscopic
level, mutations in the DNA.

53
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:47,200
The fourth change is beginning of lack of
trust in statistics.

54
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,560
Statistics nowadays are everywhere.

55
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,140
We find it in polls, in insurance, in
sports, in politics.

56
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,850
But still, even with all these great
tools, we are not fully in control.

57
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,380
For instance, one of the most dramatic
examples, earthquakes.

58
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,770
The statistics of earthquakes are pretty
well established.

59
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,510
They don't follow the bell curve.

60
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,420
they follow another kind of statistical
log, but it's a well-established log.

61
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,930
It's a power log.

62
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,460
And nevertheless, as we will know, it's
almost

63
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,290
impossible to predict where the next
earthquake will hit.

64
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,760
Similarly, when it comes to human
endeavors

65
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,330
like finance, or of course even worse
terrorism

66
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,450
and crime, these are activities that, for

67
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,610
which statistics can be applied, and are
applied.

68
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,090
But nevertheless, in some cases they fail
to predict what's going to happen.

69
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,140
These are now topic that is not going to
be dealt with in the course,

70
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:46,630
but it's a little bit of beginning of
pessimism of trying to find the limits of

71
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,280
what statistics can tell you.

72
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,420
The fifth, the fifth advance in the 20th
century

73
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,600
that I wanted to mention goes in the
opposite direction.

74
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,340
And it concerns the possibility of

75
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,280
predicting our own behavior, human
behavior.

76
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,900
The hope is from long ago, already 19th

77
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,130
century, there was a hope of recognizing
criminals.

78
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,000
For instance, by looking at their physical
traits,

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,750
at their calligraphy, different behaviors,
and

80
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,330
this proved to be essentially a failure.

81
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,170
Maybe also the idea of new behavior is
undesirable, because it would of course it

82
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:28,640
would lead to violations of privacy to be
in control of the life of other people.

83
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,570
And ultimately, one could be safe and say
oh, my behavior

84
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,300
is really unpredictable because it's my
own, it's my free will.

85
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:43,550
And these experiments in the 1980s done by
Libet challenging this vision,

86
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:45,080
at least partly.

87
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,040
They of course have raised a lot of
debates,

88
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,600
and we are going to deal with them in.

89
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,090
And finally the last development of the
20th

90
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,720
century I want to mention is information
theory.

91
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,970
The theory of how signals carry

92
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,120
information, and how information can be
processed.

93
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,590
This has been developed around the 1940s,
1950s,

94
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,630
by people like Alan Turing and Claude
Shannon.

95
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,100
Nowadays it is a very important field of
science.

96
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,280
A message I would take out of information
theory

97
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,820
here is that unpredictability and
randomness are not always bad.

98
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,920
In fact, sometimes can be used as a
resource.

99
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,618
And we are going to see in lectures two
and three a few

100
00:06:19,618 --> 00:06:22,960
examples, where randomness helps in
computing and

101
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,440
of course helps in privacy and secrecy.

102
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,460
For instance in online transactions to
make

103
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,750
sure that advertizers don't get the
information.

104
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,210
So let me summarize the six steps, the six
messages

105
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,770
from the 20th century.

106
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,190
Quantum physics, there is intrinsic
ignorance in physics.

107
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,750
Deterministic chaos, even without going to
quantum physics, and even with

108
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,670
computers, there will be ignorance in the
long term for some phenomena.

109
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,628
Chance in evolution, we ignore how we got
here.

110
00:06:52,628 --> 00:06:56,900
It would be very hard to have predicted
the rise of humans.

111
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,070
The limits of statistics have been

112
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:06,780
stated and five while unpredictability
creeps

113
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,190
in nature, our own decisions may be less
unpredictable than what we're expecting.

114
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,545
In com, in information theory, randomness
becomes

115
00:07:16,545 --> 00:07:18,890
a resource for computing and for privacy.
