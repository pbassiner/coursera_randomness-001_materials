00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:03,863
Hello.

3
00:00:03,863 --> 00:00:08,210
Welcome to this course on Unpredictable
Randomness, Chance, and Free Will.

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,500
We are going to be together for eight
weeks.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,640
Let me first share with you some technical
points.

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,750
every lecture will be divided in four to
six, four to six segments.

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,900
And at the end of the segment, we're going
to put some

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,530
references and some links for you to
click, and to deepen your knowledge.

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,410
Okay I have to say that,

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,910
this list is not a exhaustive, and
sometimes I

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,040
don't fully agree with what's written in
these references.

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,090
But, I let you build up your own knowledge
by surfing on the Internet.

13
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,149
That's ultimately the internet module, you
can use this tool.

14
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:45,047
concerning evaluation, we are going to
have

15
00:00:45,047 --> 00:00:47,700
in-video quizzes in most of the segments.

16
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,820
These ones are not marked.

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,384
It's just for you to check if you are
following what I'm saying.

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,980
And we are going to have no homework

19
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,790
but two tests.
The first test at the end of Lecture Four.

20
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,130
And the second test at the end of the
course.

21
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,110
So at the end of lecture eight.

22
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,530
The test will be multiple choice
questions,

23
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,470
and the passing grade will be 50%.

24
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,415
The statement of accomplishment 85%.

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,760
for your questions and discussions there
will a forum as is usual in Coursera

26
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,750
that will be managed by myself and by my
two teaching assistants Melvin and Yulsa.

27
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,880
This is

28
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,940
all that I wanted to say for the technical
things, really very simple.

29
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,700
So now let us move to the interesting
part, to the content.
