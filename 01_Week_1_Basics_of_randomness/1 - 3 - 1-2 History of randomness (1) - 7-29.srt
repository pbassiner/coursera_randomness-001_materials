1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,620
Now in this second segment, we are

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,570
going to start considering the history of
randomness.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,980
In this first part, we're go very fast

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,100
forward from the antiquity to the 19th
century.

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,930
Randomness has been used since antiquity
and

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:20,510
up today in these essentially three tasks.

7
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:26,090
For games, secrecy And divination, which
you may think is less frequent today,

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:26,890
but oddly it's not.

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,800
Games, well, they use randomness there
where ignorance implies fairness.

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,520
Like both players have an element of
ignorance, of unpredictability.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,080
The game is fair if one of them.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,350
can predict better than the other the game
is unfair.

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,048
Secrecy of course your want the adversary
to

14
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:49,720
ignore your message, to ignore your secret
codes.

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,150
The idea of divination is that if there is

16
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:58,560
some unpredictable phenomena for us,
someone or something must know.

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,460
And thus these being must be in control of
what's really happening.

18
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,890
And this is why divinations uses a

19
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,770
power beyond predictable phenomena to
interrogate the divinities.

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,400
Then mathematics begin.

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,130
There's not much mathematics in
divination, so

22
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,780
they kept all the games in secrecy.

23
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:25,100
In games Give rise to the first three
pieces of

24
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:31,270
probabilities until the final Probability
Theory in the 18th century.

25
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,010
The first person to somehow systematize

26
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,730
the theory of probability is Gerolamo
Cardano.

27
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,330
And you see the title

28
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,890
of his book, Liber de ludo aleae.

29
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,450
De ludo aleae means the game of dice in
Latin.

30
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:44,970
1564.

31
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,395
He was a gambler in fact, apart from being
a mathemetician and other things.

32
00:01:49,395 --> 00:01:50,385
The next

33
00:01:50,385 --> 00:01:51,930
[UNKNOWN]

34
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,230
of the development of the probability
theory

35
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,600
are some letters exchanged between Fermat
and Pascal.

36
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,700
About again, a problem of gambling that
was

37
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,330
submitted to them by one of their friends.

38
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,710
And Huygens, a few years later, writes
another book, another treatise,

39
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,080
again ludo aleae, you see there again the
game of dice.

40
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,180
About secrecy well the story's very long,
of course.

41
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:24,690
The frequency analysis on some kind of
cypher was initiated in ninth century

42
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:30,653
already by Al Kindi in the Arabic world.
And then mathematics again helped the

43
00:02:30,653 --> 00:02:31,683
[INAUDIBLE]

44
00:02:31,683 --> 00:02:36,790
Alberti in the Italian Renaissance to,
invent polyalphabetic cyphers.

45
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,680
And then the history goes.

46
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,790
Essentially by inventing and cracking
codes.

47
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:48,060
Until, let's say, let me put it as a
milestone, in 1883, Kerchkhoff's

48
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,110
principle, where this person stated that
the

49
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,600
protocol of secrecy must always be known.

50
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,200
There must be some secret code, but the

51
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,650
way we use this code must be publicly
known.

52
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,716
We come back to these topics later.

53
00:03:04,716 --> 00:03:09,330
The next tool that appears in history is
the bell curve.

54
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,880
that everybody has seen in statistic.

55
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,970
The bell curve is a very frequent

56
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,630
manifestation of statistical behavior,
although not universal.

57
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,850
You probably all know that some
assumptions go into it,

58
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,890
and there are some statistical behaviors
that are not described.

59
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:22,630
By the bell curve.

60
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,730
This was discovered by two different
paths.

61
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,310
On the one hand, De Moivre discovered that

62
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,210
this is the limiting distribution when you
toss

63
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:39,450
many coins and you ask, how many heads and
how many tails appear in a given sequence?

64
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,940
Essentially the most probable sequences of
those.

65
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,930
Where there are half heads and half tails.

66
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,850
The other way of finding the bell curve in
history was through measurement errors.

67
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,560
People were studying in physics, notably,
the fact that when you make a

68
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,300
measurement, and you repeat the
measurement

69
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,190
many times, you get always slightly
different.

70
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:07,750
Results because of the imprecision of your
eyes or of your device, and again, how

71
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,750
well the errors distributed in this case

72
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,150
finally Laplace found out that these are
distributed

73
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:14,980
according to the bell curve.

74
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:20,150
It's interesting to mention in the context
of distribution of errors something that.

75
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,890
Is the power of statistics.

76
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:27,790
The statistics tend to give certainty in
the presence of uncertainty.

77
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,420
So we cannot know the exact result.

78
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:33,860
And statistics does not help you to know
the exact result, but it

79
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:39,450
will help you to quantify rigorously how
far you may be away from

80
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,070
the exact result.

81
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,820
In the sense, statistics is a

82
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,960
science about something that is
intrinsically answered.

83
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,480
And now, I already mentioned these
treaties of 1812 of

84
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,980
Laplace, Theorie analytique de
probabilite, and I want to read

85
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,490
in full the most famous quotation of the
group, because

86
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,250
it is very relevant for the discussions in
this course.

87
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,530
Laplace writes, in French, of course, but
we'll

88
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,040
read the English translation, we may
regard the

89
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,060
present state of the universe as the
effect

90
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,150
of its past and the cause of its future.

91
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,320
An intellect which at a certain

92
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,420
moment would know all forces that set
nature in motion and

93
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,970
all positions of all the items of which
nature is composed.

94
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,710
If this intellect were also vast enough to

95
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,880
submit this data to analysis, it would
embrace in

96
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,770
a single formula the movements of the
greatest bodies

97
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,000
of the universe and those of the tiniest
atoms.

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,370
For such an intellect, nothing would be
uncertain.

99
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,310
And the future, just like the past,

100
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,060
would be present before its eyes.

101
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,014
This is the position that has often been
called physical determinism.

102
00:05:45,014 --> 00:05:51,640
And in fact we reach now, the end of the
19th century is very fast

103
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:57,460
overview of the history of randomness so
far and what are the stances there?

104
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:57,960
We have.

105
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:03,980
In physics, as we have seen, the idea is,
all is predictable.

106
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,100
And then we have statistics that will help
to cope with

107
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,880
measurement errors, and the basics have
been solidly established by them.

108
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,090
I want to finish with two quotations.

109
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,590
One is by August Comte.

110
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:25,480
The, founder of positivism, who wrote in
his book

111
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,310
The Positive Philosophy, something that
was falsified two years later.

112
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,880
Of all objects,

113
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,470
the planets are those which appear to us
under the least varied aspect.

114
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,990
We see how we may determine their forms,
their distances, their bulk, and

115
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,940
their motions, But we can never know

116
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,300
anything of their chemical or
mineralogical structure.

117
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,830
Few years later people found out that by
looking at spectral emissions

118
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:52,220
they can find out inside the chemical and
mineralogical structure of the stars.

119
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:58,444
So this confirms, seemed to confirm the
idea of LaPlace that everything would be

120
00:06:58,444 --> 00:06:58,600
[INAUDIBLE].

121
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,150
In fact, a few years later at the
beginning of the twentieth century.

122
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,400
Michelson was giving a conference and then
wrote it in a book

123
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,510
the following sentence, The more important

124
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,750
fundamental laws and facts of physical
science

125
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,800
have all been discovered, and these are so
firmly established that the possibility

126
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,700
of their ever being supplanted in

127
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,140
consequence of new discoveries is
exceedingly remote.

128
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,780
He's also known to have quoted after
reason by Lord Kelvin

129
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,900
will say that the future of physics is

130
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,340
in the sixth deci-, decimal place of
perception.
