1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,750
After this short introduction on the
course, let us start with the

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,080
very first lecture, in which I will
introduce the basics of randomness.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,550
Here is the Plan of this Lecture.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,444
The general title if you want or the
general message is to introduce the

5
00:00:15,444 --> 00:00:20,060
various nuances of unpredictable of this
word that will stay with us all the time.

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:25,040
And in the first segment of the lecture, I
will in fact define words.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,344
I will define three words,

8
00:00:26,344 --> 00:00:28,150
randomness, chance, and free will.

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,810
In the second and the third segment, I

10
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,920
will go rapidly through a history of
randomness.

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,250
First, in the from antiquity to nineteenth
century, and

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,990
then in the twentieth century some changes
have happened there.

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,590
In the fourth segment that we introduced a
fair coin,

14
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,320
which is usually the idea, the exemplary
model, for randomness.

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,270
And in the last two segments five and six,
I was

16
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,170
spent time defining the the notion of
randomness in two different ways.

17
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,040
First segment is about these three words
that

18
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,090
will come up very often during this
lecture.

19
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,840
The first word of course is Randomness.

20
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,710
What does randomness mean?

21
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,170
It means Lack of predictability.

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,799
First example, as I said we are going to
see the

23
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,366
[UNKNOWN]

24
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:19,267
later is the coin tossing.

25
00:01:19,267 --> 00:01:23,440
As we all know we have ignorance of the
result of each toss.

26
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,030
And this leads to a, lack of pattern in
the sequence

27
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,820
degenerator, normally, because sometimes a

28
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,880
sequence generated could have some
pattern.

29
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,837
Another example is polling, obviously
sample from a population.

30
00:01:38,837 --> 00:01:39,656
The goal is

31
00:01:39,656 --> 00:01:40,475
[INAUDIBLE]

32
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:44,752
ignore which item will be picked, so that
we cannot base

33
00:01:44,752 --> 00:01:49,928
our selection on some other criteria that
would buy us some thing.

34
00:01:49,928 --> 00:01:54,840
And important notion is also that, of
Single events vs statistics.

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,494
So, what is unpredictable of single events
quite

36
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:03,080
often, the statistics will be predictable
will be known.

37
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,812
So, there is some regularity there, we can
do science

38
00:02:05,812 --> 00:02:09,900
with them but we cannot predict what will
happen in every single draw,

39
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,780
in every single toss of the coin, in every
single run of a process.

40
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,020
Second, what is Chance?
Chance usually refers to coincidence.

41
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,970
Coincidence, which means, concurrent
uncorrelated causes.

42
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,990
Let me explain these with an example of
doing something that,

43
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,320
for sure, we have met many, many times in
our lives.

44
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,370
In this novel by Thornton Wilder, The
Bridge of San Luis

45
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:41,030
Rey, it opens with an interesting case
where five people are walking

46
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,660
on a bridge at the moment when the bridge

47
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,090
collapses, and these five people fall to
their death.

48
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,990
The whole novel is about trying to find
out, if

49
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:55,120
there was a sort of divine plan big plan
for

50
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,080
these people to be there on the bridge
exactly the

51
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,160
moment it collapses, or if it all is pure
coincidence.

52
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:06,150
This is what we refer to as chance.
So, in a basic view,

53
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,790
each of these five persons had their own
reason to be on

54
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,060
the bridge, so there was a cause for them
to be there.

55
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,680
And of course it was a cause for the
bridge to collapse.

56
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,230
The roads were weak, or whatever other the
problem the bridge had.

57
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,800
And the only thing that was not
predictable was the fact that the bridge

58
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,200
would collapse exactly at the moment,
where

59
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,342
those five people would walk through it.

60
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,920
As I mentioned here with the topic of this
book,

61
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,880
often when we speak of chance, there is a
desire

62
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,200
in us human beings to try to see a deeper

63
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,870
cause beneath the coincidence, especially
when this coincidence is tragic.

64
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,990
This doesn't mean that this cause is
there, but we'd like to try to find it.

65
00:03:45,836 --> 00:03:47,800
What is the ration with randomness?

66
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,620
Well, of course some of the causes can be
modeled as random processes but it

67
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,100
can also be the case that neither cause is
random.

68
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,280
Neither process is random.

69
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,770
And only the conjunction is unpredictable.

70
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,970
That's, the slight difference between
chance and randomness.

71
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,940
And finally free will, so free will
usually refers to our choices.

72
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,970
Especially in a, in a moral context.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,630
An example would be if I said nobody's
looking at me in a shopping mall.

74
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,940
Should I steal this object?

75
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,650
Now, clearly what is the relation with
randomness here?

76
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,410
Clearly for me, the choice is not random.

77
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,300
I'm not going to choose to steal or not to
steal by tossing a coin.

78
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,180
This decision would be based, on my
principles, on

79
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,560
my values, on my religion, or whatever
they see or

80
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,160
my vision of society, or my desire for
comfort

81
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,010
if I choose to steal, whatever other
principle it is.

82
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,230
I'm not going to choose at random.

83
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,190
However if you don't know me and you see
me

84
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,140
there you don't know which decision I'm
going to take.

85
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,520
So, my behavior is unpredictable for you,
for someone who, doesn't know me.

86
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,060
In this sense even

87
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,020
the behavior of freewill look random to an

88
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,810
observer who is not familiar with the
person.

89
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,930
What all these notions have in common is
the idea of Lack of information.

90
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,130
We lack some information, and as a
consequence

91
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,720
very often, lack of information implies
lack of control.

92
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,750
You're not in control of what's happening.
This goes with the examples.

93
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,840
I don't know exactly how the coin is going
to be tossed, even by my fingers.

94
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,670
So, I can't predict the outcome.

95
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:30,130
For chance, I can't imagine all that is
happening around me and may affect me.

96
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:30,460
Something

97
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,690
I don't know, like some car accident in
the street,

98
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:37,030
something that doesn't depend on me but
can affect my life.

99
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,710
And I also can't predict the behavior of
others.

100
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,830
So this is the crucial issue, lack of
information is

101
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,960
normally the cause of randomness and all
these related notions.

102
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,310
Now, as you see, we could be speaking of
many things in this course.

103
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,810
And here I'm going to show you what we are
going to

104
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,890
deal with and what unfortunately, we don't
have time to deal with.

105
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,390
So we're going to deal with,

106
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,950
the Mathematical definition of randomness,
which as

107
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,090
you are going to see in this lecture is
not at all trivial.

108
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,880
We're going to deal as randomness as a
resource, as something positive.

109
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,610
It would be very frequent that
unpredictability

110
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,560
is in fact something good rather than bad.

111
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,975
Then we're going to deal with sources of
randomness in the physical world.

112
00:06:21,975 --> 00:06:25,870
That we'll say more about this later, and
then of course in the following lectures,

113
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:31,270
and finally we will discuss something of
the, the take of science on free will.

114
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,560
Among the many things we're not going to

115
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,390
deal with, there is, Chance in biological
evolution.

116
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,600
serious Statistics and decision making.

117
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,880
Of course, a little bit of statistics
here, here

118
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,530
and there, but this is not a course about
statistics.

119
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,880
We're not going to deal with Predictions

120
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,930
in finance, politics, force, and other
human activities.

121
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,630
We're not going to deal with the topic of

122
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,560
Destiny, fate, that I hinted to at the
beginning.

123
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,135
that of course is a dominant topic in
philosophy and in literature

124
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:08,910
worldwide with a sort of full study there.
We're not going to offer it.

125
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,590
And also, we're not going to deal with
religions and how someone who has a

126
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,030
religion view can consider randomness and
free

127
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,570
will in a context of all powerful God.

128
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:23,400
Well, of a universe that repeats itself
regularly.
