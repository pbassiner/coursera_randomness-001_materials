00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,090
Hello, welcome to the seventh lecture in
which we will

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,960
finally discuss this topic of intrinsic
randomness from quantum physics.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,360
And also we'll finish by stressing its
practical uses.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:18,730
Here is the plan of our lecture that will
be focused on this notion of violation

5
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:23,330
of Bell inequalities that are the proof
ultimately of intrinsic randomness.

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,870
In the first segment,

7
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:30,530
I will discuss the notion of
pre-established agreement, that

8
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,630
is, the opposite, if you want, of
intrinsic randomness.

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,200
Then, in the second and third segment, I
will

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,070
discuss this theorem by John Bell and its
implications.

11
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,170
And in the fourth segment, I will discuss

12
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:48,110
quantum information, which are the
applications of intrinsic randomness.

13
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,950
There are only four segments here but they
are pretty dense so stay

14
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,060
with me.

15
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,350
We start with the pre-established
agreement.

16
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,430
Remember what we saw in the previous
lecture about black boxes.

17
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,350
We have one box in which we can put an
input.

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,082
In that case it was the difference of
length in a, a

19
00:01:05,082 --> 00:01:09,590
[UNKNOWN] thermometer, and we get an
output plus 1 or minus 1.

20
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,280
And we were asking whether, what is inside
this

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,080
box can be certified to be quantum or even

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,080
can be certified to be intrinsically
random.

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,500
And as you remember, we found out that
this cannot

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,710
be done, because in the box, there could
be a simulator,

25
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,960
someone, or even a computer, who has the
instruction how

26
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,580
to react to the input and how to produce
the outputs.

27
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,610
Now I want to extend a little bit just

28
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,250
to notice that these instructions in
particular could be predetermined.

29
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,250
So a way

30
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,120
to generate this particular probability
distribution would be

31
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,980
to have decided it in advance, whatever,
what

32
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:54,140
to do for every call, for every time an
input is put and an output is given.

33
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,700
And for every value of delta l.

34
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,900
Of course, it's not very economical to
have such a long list.

35
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,910
It's easier to have a sort of random

36
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:05,440
number generator here, but this is
certainly possible.

37
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,580
So this user or

38
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,490
this computer could just have a list that
says in the first

39
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,130
call, if delta l is equal to 0, you should
output plus 1.

40
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,840
If delta l is equal, let's say, to lambda
over 10, you output plus 1.

41
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,900
If it's lambda over 5, you output minus 1,
and

42
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,770
so on for all possible values of that
delta l.

43
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,020
And then as a similar instruction, but
different in values here, for the

44
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,950
second call, for the third call, for the
fourth call, and so on.

45
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,730
And if the box

46
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,010
is queried many times, ultimately the
promise is

47
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,090
that all these will give the correct
statistics.

48
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,350
Okay, for instance as you see here,
whenever delta l is equal to

49
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,040
0, the output must be always plus 1, and
here is what I put.

50
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,680
So this is the important point to stress,
that whenever

51
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,720
such a simulation is possible, the output
may be predetermined.

52
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,979
Maybe it is not, but it is certainly
possible that it is predetermined.

53
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,800
Now let's see what happens if we try to

54
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,530
do the same, these pre-established
strategies, with two parties.

55
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,980
And this time, I will only use two

56
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,330
inputs instead of the whole possibilities
of delta

57
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,560
l in order to simplify the argument.

58
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,810
The argument works already with two
inputs.

59
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,910
So here we have Alice, in her lab.

60
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:27,690
And she has one of these pre-established
strategies.

61
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,090
If x is equal to 0 or if x is equal to 1
in the first call out, plus 1.

62
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,260
In the second call, if x is equal to 0,
you output minus

63
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,750
1, if x is equal to 1, we output plus 1,
and so on.

64
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,360
Bob has a similar list.

65
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,540
Importantly Alice and Bob may share the
other persons' list.

66
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,690
So Alice and Bob might have met in advance
and have agreed upon a strategy.

67
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,050
So now Alice in addition to having her
list.

68
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:00,710
She may also know Bob's list and similarly
Bob may also know Alice's list.

69
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,022
Again, because they came together,

70
00:04:02,022 --> 00:04:04,108
that's why it's called, pre-established
agreement.

71
00:04:04,108 --> 00:04:08,250
That it's pre-established because all of
the values are

72
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,270
guessed in advance, and is agreement
because

73
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,630
Alice and Bob share each others' lists.

74
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,930
So what can you do with pre-established
agreement?

75
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,000
What kind of games, if you want?

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,360
You can simulate, you can win.

77
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,330
But clearly a game that you can win is
this one.

78
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,560
If you are given the same input, given the
same output.

79
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,170
How do you do that?

80
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:33,160
Well just take identical lists.
And clearly here, you see that if,

81
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,340
for, let's take a non-trivial case.

82
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,720
If Alice receive 0 and Bob receive 0, they
both output minus 1.

83
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,890
If Alice receive 1 and Bob receives 1,
they both output plus 1.

84
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,490
And that's it.

85
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,490
In fact, it is pretty obvious.

86
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,185
You just share the same list of
instructions,

87
00:04:49,185 --> 00:04:51,830
then you would behave exactly in the same
way.

88
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,960
Now, this is not purely academic, this is

89
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,180
done almost every day, for instance, take
an example

90
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,150
in which two agents of the same company
are going to the stock market.

91
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,570
And bidding for something.

92
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,790
But what they have to bid for depends on
whether a given

93
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,270
party wins the elections, or the other
party gives the wins the elections.

94
00:05:13,388 --> 00:05:17,260
So, they are the agents are in different
locations, in different stock exchange

95
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:22,920
buildings, and they have to wait for the
information, say which party has won.

96
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,480
And this

97
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:28,750
would be the input, x and y, and upon of
receiving this input,

98
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:33,710
well, if party number one has won, they
sell, if party number two

99
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:39,430
has won, they buy.
This is a very natural situation.

100
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,090
Is there something you cannot do with
shared agreement?

101
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,410
And the answer is yes, there are

102
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,870
things they cannot do with pre-established
agreement.

103
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,610
Take the following

104
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,720
game, Alice and Bob should output the
same,

105
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,770
always the same, systematically the same,
this seems trivial.

106
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:01,270
Unless in one case, unless both receive
the input 1.

107
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,890
In this case they have to output
different.

108
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,620
So see what happens.

109
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,860
Suppose that Alice has decided, okay, what
she has is fixed.

110
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,000
So here for instance, you decided the
output plus 1.

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,990
Now, here, Bob also outputs plus 1, but
here what,

112
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,200
what Bob has to do depends on x.

113
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,540
You see if x is equal to 0, then Bob has
to output plus 1.

114
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,060
If x is equal to 1, however, Bob has to
output minus 1, because

115
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,640
when x is equal to y is equal to 1, they
have to output differently.

116
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:34,010
So here you see that, on Bob's side, the
instructions are not complete.

117
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:39,070
In order to win this game, Bob needs to
know something about Alice,

118
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,400
and, concretely, about the actual input of
Alice.

119
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,590
What is the input that Alice received?

120
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,300
Now, how do you solve this game, this
problem, classically?

121
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,837
Alice should call Bob.

122
00:06:50,837 --> 00:06:55,659
Should send a message to Bob, and tell him
I received X equals 0.

123
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:59,420
ha, Bob knows this, and therefore act
accordingly.

124
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,530
Okay, suppose now that we leave Alice and
Bob

125
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:04,590
in peace, and we have back our black
boxes.

126
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,326
We run these black boxes, we'll put

127
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:08,806
inputs, get outputs, put inputs, get
outputs.

128
00:07:08,806 --> 00:07:14,706
And we notice that these black boxes
achieve successfully this game,

129
00:07:14,706 --> 00:07:18,790
same output unless x is equal to y is
equal to 1.

130
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:23,050
So what do you conclude?
You see these, this is unquestionable.

131
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,040
That's the statistics you observe.
Don't go too fast!

132
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,530
There is a necessary conclusion.

133
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,800
The necessary conclusion is that at least
one

134
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,590
of the outcomes was not pre-established.

135
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,100
Remember that before, it was Bob's outcome
that needed an input.

136
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,620
It could be Alice's outcome.

137
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,950
But one of the two, at least, or maybe
both, are not pre-established.

138
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,940
That's necessary conclusion.

139
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,740
Now, of course, since we are accustomed to
the

140
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,370
classical world, you would say, oh, then
these boxes are

141
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,480
signalling, one of the boxes is sending a
signal to

142
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,180
the other, and that's how they can win
this game.

143
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,820
But, what happens if you're in a situation

144
00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:00,540
where no signal can have been sent.
Is there such a situation?

145
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,660
There is.

146
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,700
As you know, no signal should propagate
faster than light,

147
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,920
so if these two boxes are very far apart,
a

148
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,800
signal from x to b, as is drawn here in

149
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,160
the slide, should travel faster than
light, and this is impossible.

150
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,870
Now, this is exactly, however, or similar
to what two

151
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,750
quantum particles, separated by the large
distance, can do.

152
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,370
Two quantum particles can win this game,
or

153
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,480
aproximately win this game, I'll come back
to this

154
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:34,350
later, at a distance such that if you want
to explain what you see by a signal.

155
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,870
You need the signal to travel faster than

156
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,750
light, which is essentially impossible in
our universe.

157
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,610
So, how do you explain it?

158
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,350
Well, this is the question we are going to
see in the next part.
