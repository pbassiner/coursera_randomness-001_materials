00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,010
The last segment of this lecture is a
short

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,850
introduction to the research field of
quantum information science.

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:13,170
Quantum information is maybe, first of all
a matter of attitude.

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,370
This is the attitude that many people have

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,190
had along the last century about quantum
physics.

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,100
And certainly, the attitude I was taught
quantum physics with.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,010
It's a very predictive theory, you need to

8
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,270
know it, otherwise you're not a physicist,
but

9
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,920
you are essentially, you can forget about
understanding

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,400
it, because you cannot know both position
and momentum,

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,380
you cannot predict the outcome of a
measurement

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,700
with certainty, only the statistics, and
so on.

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,240
So it seems something, a pretty bleak
picture.

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,520
Of essentially giving up knowledge.
Well it is not, of course.

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,130
Quantum physics is a great discovery of
human spirit.

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,560
Now the attitude of quantum information is
rather hey, look up

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,510
they are, there is a source of real
randomness out there.

18
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,160
So we can use it.

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,860
Let's stop complaining, let's stop whining
that we cannot know position and momentum.

20
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,510
If we cannot know position and momentum,
we can get randomness out of it.

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,135
Let me give a brief overview of what
quantum information is.

22
00:01:12,135 --> 00:01:16,980
There essentially 2 big, big fields and
then a lot of other

23
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,340
things that I cannot tell you now because
we cannot go so specialized.

24
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,300
One of the main tasks of

25
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,840
quantum information is called quantum
cryptography.

26
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,950
We know about this cryptography.

27
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,990
And in fact, the main help of quantum
physics

28
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:36,480
is to distribute a key for use in one-time
pad.

29
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,640
For some reason, quantum physics does not
help

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,800
for instance in protocols like RSA, in
public-key cryptography.

31
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,670
Another task is the generation of

32
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,660
secure random numbers, cryptographically
secure random numbers.

33
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,020
The idea of quantum cryptography

34
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,990
was discovered independently by Bennett
and Brassard

35
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,520
in 1984 and by Arthur Ekert n 1991.

36
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,770
And I will describe these 2 ideas shortly
later.

37
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,350
The present state of, of quantum
cryptography

38
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,790
is that essentially it's a regular
commercial product.

39
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,418
Then I see a little bit of development in
the academic world, but

40
00:02:12,418 --> 00:02:17,180
in its basic configuration it, it has
already being developed up to the

41
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,615
point of being first a prototype and then
even now

42
00:02:19,615 --> 00:02:22,310
probably you can buy it, if you have
security needs.

43
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,260
The other big chunk of quantum information
is quantum computing.

44
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,550
The main task of quantum computing is,
speed

45
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,770
up some protocols, and in particular, a
scary one

46
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,990
is that a quantum computer would be able

47
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:39,770
to factor integers faster than any known
classical algorithms.

48
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,650
Now if you remember that factoring
integers

49
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,720
is a crucial step in the security of RSA,
the public key cryptography.

50
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,800
If one is able to factor integers faster
than, than, than, than exponentials.

51
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,920
In fact, if [INAUDIBLE] in a polynomial
time then the RSA becomes insecure.

52
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,130
This is the main result of Peter Shor in
1994, it's called Shor's algorithm.

53
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,280
Okay, since of course, there have been

54
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,400
lots of developments and research and so
on.

55
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,580
But in terms of realization of a quantum

56
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,430
computer, the present status is still very
far away.

57
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,060
People are working on simpler, relevant
applications.

58
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,690
If you have heard of the...in the

59
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,020
press of some companies buying some
quantum computer.

60
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,470
It's still debated whether this is really
quantum.

61
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,200
Anyway, it's not a full quantum computer.

62
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,140
Those quantum computers cannot factor in
figures, but they can do something else

63
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,540
that is already a speed up over what you
can do with classical computing.

64
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,560
I'm not going to speak of quantum
computing anymore here.

65
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,940
I will focus now my little examples of

66
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,930
quantum cryptography, random number
generation, and the key distribution.

67
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,910
So here is a trusted random number
generator.

68
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,690
In fact, you know it already, it's our
beloved beam splitter.

69
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:55,170
So we have a source sending some
particles, typically photons.

70
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,180
For beam splitter, and then there are 2
detectors.

71
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,870
If the first detector clicks, the
transmitter detector

72
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,540
clicks, we call it a 0 now, and if the
reflected detector clicks, we call it a 1.

73
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,065
We have to recall that this is a trusted
random number generator in the sense that

74
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:16,350
these kinds of single particle devices do
not withstand a black box test.

75
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,530
If you don't trust the vendor and you just
see the statistics, one

76
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,580
half here, one half there, it

77
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,050
might have been generated by
computer-deterministic means.

78
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,950
So this means in other words, that you
have to characterize, both

79
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,050
as the producer and as the end user, you
must characterize the

80
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,380
source and the beam splitter, or trust the
source and the beam

81
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,250
splitter in order to be sure that this
device is generating randomness.

82
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,270
Now, this is not a big deal.

83
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,410
Remember that we have to do the same in
classical physics, for a

84
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,900
classical random number generator, we have
to do the same for the resistor.

85
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,170
In order to extract the randomness

86
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,100
from the resistor, we had first to check

87
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,940
that it behaves as a resistor should
behave.

88
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,110
So this is not a default of this.

89
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,980
This is just using quantum physics in a
sort of normal way.

90
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,570
Of course, thanks to Bell inequalities, we
can

91
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,988
use quantum physics in a more paranoid
way.

92
00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:14,510
Here, if you generically run the numbers
using Bell inequalities, then a and b.

93
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,010
Are random,

94
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:22,656
even for the producer, even for the one
who has sold you the source and the 2

95
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:26,620
boxes, black boxes, provided of course the
Bell

96
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,670
inequality is violated and provided there
is no signalling.

97
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,470
So this box cannot be fully black, you
must trust that there is no radio inside.

98
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,820
Of course if the.

99
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,760
The vendor has put a radio here that
reveals to the

100
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,400
world or to the NSA the list of bits, then
the randomness

101
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,650
would be compromised.

102
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,350
But if there is no signal from this box to
the other, if you put the boxes

103
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,300
far apart, so that no signal can
propagate,

104
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,120
then this certifies randomness in a black
box scenario.

105
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,410
The fact that the users don't need to

106
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,260
characterize the devices is what I call
device-independent.

107
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,530
Another interesting feature here is that,
remember, we

108
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,588
have to assess min-entropies in order to
extract randomness.

109
00:06:06,588 --> 00:06:09,580
Now, the min-entropy

110
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,520
is a function of the violation of Bell
inequality.

111
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,600
So if you observe the violation of Bell
inequality,

112
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,290
immediately you can say, How much is the
guessing probability?

113
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,910
How much is the min-entropy of that
source?

114
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,040
And a particular case I want to mention is

115
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,630
that if you would violate the Bell
inequality to

116
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:31,090
the quantum maximum of 2 square root of 2,
then both a and b are perfect fair coins.

117
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,630
Not uncorrelated, so each one depend a
little

118
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:39,680
bit on the other, but taken apart, each of
them is a perfect fair coin.

119
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,100
Now let's go to key distribution.

120
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,600
Again, there are 2 possible scenarios, one
using only

121
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,370
one particle, the other one using Bell
inequalities, 2 particles.

122
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:52,140
The BB84, Bennett and Brassard 1984
protocol that I'm not going to describe in

123
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,760
detail, but it essentially uses one of

124
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,170
these Mach-Zehnder interferometers, so a
version of it.

125
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,300
Between the lab of Alice that is the
source and

126
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,950
sent something and the lab of Bob who has
the detectors.

127
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,230
Now the idea here why quantum physics

128
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,400
helps is because measurement modifies the
observation.

129
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,230
And who is going to measure?
Well Eve.

130
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,330
Eve is the eavesdropper in the middle.

131
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,610
Who wants to get the information about
what is being sent by Alice.

132
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,480
But if Eve comes in and listens and tries
to

133
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,840
measure, get some information, Alice and
Bob will notice it.

134
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,380
So you see here how an idea

135
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,480
of quantum physics is, one of these weird
ideas that we

136
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,510
don't find very comfortable, like
measurement

137
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,890
modifies the observation, becomes an
advantage.

138
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,240
If measurement modifies the observation,
The

139
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,910
eavesdropper cannot measure without being
noticed.

140
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:42,260
Again, there's an element of trust here.
This is a one-particle device.

141
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,100
Alice and Bob need to characterize their
devices.

142
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,370
They need to know how the source works,
how the beam-splitters work, and so on.

143
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,750
Rebuild Bell.
Again, you can do it device independent.

144
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,860
That's the idea of Ekert, although the
idea of device independence is much later.

145
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,846
And in fact, I'm very happy to be one of
those who had these ideas.

146
00:07:57,846 --> 00:08:03,560
But Ekert already in 1991, had the correct
intuition, namely that

147
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,330
if a Bell inequality is violated, the
results do not pre-exist.

148
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:11,330
So if Eve is listening out there, there's
just nothing to listen to.

149
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,240
There's nothing to learn.
The results do not exist.

150
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,790
The results are sort of created At the
moment of

151
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,120
the measurement in the locations of Alice
and

152
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,220
Bob that of course is supposed to be
secure.

153
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,480
So here Alice and Bob need to ensure
no-signaling.

154
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,800
Again, no radio inside the black box.

155
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,220
But do not need to characterize their
devices otherwise.

156
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,160
So again, this is one of these
device-independent scenarios.

157
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,320
And again notice that okay, we used the
violation of Bell

158
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,290
inequality, the effects of the results of
the measurement do not pre-exist.

159
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:41,200
We use them for something useful, to hide
this information

160
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,740
from an eavesdropper, even one with
unlimited computational power.

161
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,410
So I've come to the end of this important
lecture 7, in which we

162
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,860
discussed the intrinsic randomness of
quantum physics

163
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,770
used in the violation of Bell
inequalities.

164
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,440
What have we seen?

165
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,930
We have seen that 2 black boxes cannot
always

166
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,840
be simulated with pre-established data,
contrary to one black box.

167
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,510
So it's really useful to have these 2
boxes instead of one,

168
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,430
because there is something that suddenly

169
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,680
you cannot do anymore with pre-established
agreement.

170
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,719
You need either signalling or quantum
resources.

171
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,170
So if a Bell inequality is violated, the
outcomes are not pre-established.

172
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:25,940
If the outcomes are not pre-established,
of course, they cannot be predicted.

173
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,360
The violation of Bell inequalities has
been observed in many experiments,

174
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,570
and quantum information, this whole
research field, can be seen as

175
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:36,180
a way of making all these Outlandish
claims

176
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,790
of quantum physics, accepting them and
making them useful.

177
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,740
Thank you for your attention and see you
next week.
