1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,790
Now that we've stated and demonstrated

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,780
Bell's theorem let us consider its
implications.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,200
First of all, little bit of history of
this concept.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,670
A lot has been written on these.

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,695
I will just sketch it and then you

6
00:00:15,695 --> 00:00:18,935
can go online and find whatever you find
suitable.

7
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:22,016
The idea that the outcomes of measurements
are

8
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:26,060
not pre-established was an early dogma of
quantum theory.

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:31,163
Early 1920s, 1926 when quantum theory was
firmly established,

10
00:00:31,163 --> 00:00:35,942
most physicists accepted it especially
Niels Bohr was very vocal

11
00:00:35,942 --> 00:00:41,126
about this but whole the young generation
and essentially followed him.

12
00:00:41,126 --> 00:00:45,676
Only Einstein, SchrÃ¶dinger, maybe de
Broglie, and a few

13
00:00:45,676 --> 00:00:49,379
others, but not many, did not like this
idea.

14
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,219
And they were hoping to save

15
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:54,099
determinism with something that came to be

16
00:00:54,099 --> 00:00:58,168
called local hidden variables and
sometimes written LHV.

17
00:00:58,168 --> 00:01:00,572
Now what is the, what are these local
hidden variables?

18
00:01:00,572 --> 00:01:08,080
Nothing as that pre-established but one of
the problems at the time was that it

19
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,640
was not formulated in a clean operational
way like the one I did in this lecture.

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,240
Like the one we have been, we have been
doing in physics for a

21
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,010
couple of decades now.

22
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:22,410
It was rather abstract and sounded
philosophical.

23
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,290
It had some variables that are hidden.

24
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,890
And indeed, until John Bell came in onto
the scene, the debate between local hidden

25
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:36,040
variables and let's say, no
pre-established, so intrinsic

26
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,600
randomness remain purely conceptual.
Some people like local hidden variables.

27
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,350
They are free to believe in them.

28
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,680
Some others don't like local hidden
variables.

29
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,670
They are free not to believe in them and
to believe in instrinic randomness.

30
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,978
It's a matter of just coffee table
discussion.

31
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:58,140
John Bell was apartism initially of the
hidden variable model, or at least he

32
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,790
tried to write down an explicit model

33
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,610
that reproduces the prediction of quantum
theory.

34
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,710
After all, if it's possible to reproduce
the prediction

35
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,230
of quantum theory with such a model it
would

36
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:10,250
be nice to write down one and see how it
works.

37
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,300
And that's when he found out that it is

38
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,660
impossible to write down a local variable
model, because

39
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,970
he found the Bell inequality that shows
that the

40
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,880
predictions of quantum theory are not
compatible with pre-established agreement.

41
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,820
So really the, the, the, the first scam,
the orthodox scam, was right in a sense.

42
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,360
Einstein was wrong.

43
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,840
Now the story's not finished, because
when,

44
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,640
Bell wrote his inequality, even if quantum
mechanics has been successful

45
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,360
for decades, predicting many things, and
many experiments have been made, there

46
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,600
were no available data, that matched the
kind of data needed for a Bell test with

47
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,740
two separated articles being measured
almost simultaneously.

48
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,190
And collecting the statistics separately
for, for each particle.

49
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,970
So there was a need for a dedicated
experiment, not that many

50
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,710
people cared, because anyway, everybody
already believed in the absence of local

51
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,300
variables, but some people liked the idea,
liked the challenge, took it up.

52
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,820
In the 1970s, there was some attempts of
doing this experiment.

53
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,800
They were not conclusive, unfortunately.

54
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,860
The first conclusive attempt, the first
conclusive Bell test, is the one performed

55
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,840
by Alain Aspect and his coworkers in Orsay
in Paris in 1981 and 1982.

56
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,170
In fact, is a series of three tests.

57
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,820
What Alain Aspect and coworkers used were
two photons,

58
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,770
so, two particles of light, if you want,
sent

59
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,990
away from a central source to two
different locations

60
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,370
in their lab, and measured at these
different locations.

61
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,400
And since Orsay experiment, there have
been many,

62
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,720
many, many others, confirming the
violation of Bell inequalities.

63
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,080
I mentioned just two of them, why, because
they are famous.

64
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,770
Both in 1998 in Geneva,

65
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,680
the group of Nicolas Gisin managed to see
a violation

66
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,100
of Bell inequalities by photons that were
detected ten kilometers apart.

67
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,700
So really macroscopic distance and the
photons were sent

68
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,000
in optical telecom fibers installed by the
Swiss telecom.

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,386
So commercial fibers.

70
00:04:04,386 --> 00:04:07,240
They just borrowed, the, the physicists
borrowed

71
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,520
the commercial fibers, they put the
photons into

72
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,890
them, and their detectors at the end, and

73
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,630
managed to see this violation of Bell
inequality.

74
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,510
Same year, essentially also same month,
the group of Anton

75
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,240
Zeilinger, then in Innsbruck, now he is in
Vienna, implemented for

76
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,200
the first time Bell's experiment where the
choice X and

77
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:30,070
Y, the inputs, were really chosen at
random in each run.

78
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,840
Since then, in the 21st century, so, from
the

79
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,930
year 2000 onward, there have been many,
many more tests.

80
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,650
Tests involving more than two photons.

81
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,890
Tests involving two ions, two atoms
separated.

82
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,890
One atom and one photon, and so on.

83
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,530
All of them confirming the predictions of

84
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,190
quantum theory that the Bell inequalities
have violated.

85
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,910
So let us stay within our universe for a
moment.

86
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,480
If the Bell inequality is violated, there
is no pre-established agreement.

87
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,980
So this means that the outcome of at least
one of the boxes did not pre-exist.

88
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,270
What can we conclude from that?
We can think, hey, there is a signal.

89
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,720
If there is a signal, the process can be
deterministic, as we have seen.

90
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,930
Remember the very first example we saw of
a

91
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,700
process that cannot be done with local,
with pre-established agreement.

92
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,426
If Alice sends to Bob the X, Bob can

93
00:05:24,426 --> 00:05:28,198
have chosen in advance what to apply for
each X.

94
00:05:28,198 --> 00:05:30,600
Or there is no signal.

95
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,040
And then the process is even worse.
It cannot even be deterministic.

96
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,666
It must be some really creation of
information on the spot.

97
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,450
Now to explain quantam exexperient with a
signal, as

98
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,560
I said before, the signal should propagate
faster than light.

99
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,560
And in fact, some recent theoretical
studies proved that

100
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,920
not only faster than light but at infinite
speed.

101
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,850
Which is really very hard to conceive.

102
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:55,620
I just want to convey a

103
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,730
little anecdote, even Newton did not
believe in infinite speed signals.

104
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,260
So when he realized, and it's written in
his book,

105
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:07,360
that his gravity theory implied that the
moon reacts immediately

106
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,340
to the earth, instantaneously, with
infinite speed, he clearly wrote,

107
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,360
this cannot be, but for the moment, I
cannot do better.

108
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,760
And indeed, it took until Einstein to find
out that

109
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,100
even gravity propagates at most at the
speed of light.

110
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,660
So you see,

111
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,240
something at infinite speed is not
something

112
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,280
that a physicist should be at ease with.

113
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,170
In fact, you may ask if this corresponds
to

114
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,630
our universe, something where it goes at
infinite speed.

115
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,429
But okay, let this debate aside.

116
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,380
So let us now come to our famous topic of
Intrinsic randomness.

117
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,420
Let us consider what kind of randomness
can we infer

118
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,470
if we assume that there is a signal or
that

119
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,830
there is no signal.

120
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,770
Before starting I need to make a
disclaimer.

121
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:56,000
Disclaimer is that the overwhelming
majority of physicists accept that

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,900
no signal is involved in quantum violation
of Bell inequalities.

123
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,170
So if I appear here to treat the with

124
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:07,190
signal and without signal options on the
same footing, it

125
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,100
is just because as you will see, at the

126
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,380
end of the day, for my message of
intrinsic randomness.

127
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,990
It doesn't really matter.

128
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,340
In both cases we are going to conclude

129
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,490
that there is a form of intrinsic
randomness.

130
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:25,410
However, I really want to stress that the
with-signal approach is accepted

131
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:29,420
only by very, very, few physicists, and I
am not one of them.

132
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,140
So let's start with it.

133
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,410
If there is a signal, as I said before,
the process could be deterministic.

134
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,820
Nevertheless, the outcomes

135
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,570
are still unpredictable for anyone who
cannot

136
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,780
read the signal, who cannot read the
communication.

137
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,870
Now we call that the wave of Bohm that
essentially

138
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,400
would be the mechanism responsible to
carry this signal around.

139
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,520
Or any similar mechanism is postulated to
be unobservable.

140
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,100
So here there is a form of intrinsic

141
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,190
randomness in the sense that if, indeed,
the object

142
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,950
that carries the signal, this infinitely
rigid ether that carries

143
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,850
an infinite speed signal, however crazy it
sounds, sounds pretty crazy.

144
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,090
If we cannot read it, if we cannot measure
it,

145
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:19,870
if we cannot assess it, then we cannot
predict the results.

146
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,180
Even if nature, if you will, a being

147
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,350
that could read that signal, would see
determinism.

148
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,460
Now without signal well, that's even
simpler for randomness,

149
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,939
the outcomes are unpredictable for anyone
in our universe.

150
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,330
Now, you may have heard that there is

151
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,060
something called the "Many-worlds"
interpretation of quantum physics.

152
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,520
I'm not going to enter into detail on what
it is, also, because

153
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,330
people, even the supporters of the
interpretation

154
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,540
sometimes differ on what exactly it means.

155
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,130
Essentially, this interpretation is a way
of recovering determinism

156
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,609
for an observer who would see many
parallel universes.

157
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,570
So the idea is that there are many
parallel universes,

158
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,470
each one apparently behaving at random,
but

159
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,000
on the whole scale, everything is
deterministic.

160
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,770
But again, here we are speaking of an

161
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:10,120
observer who can look over all possible
universes.

162
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,420
So my conclusion is that even if you're
willing to invoke either infinite speeds

163
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,390
or parallel universes in order to save

164
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,970
some form of determinism out there in
nature,

165
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,520
the violation of Bell inequalities implies
intrinsic

166
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,260
randomness for us users in our universe.

167
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,650
And remember that I don't think we can say
much more than that.

168
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:36,050
But remember that we always have to say,
is it random for whom?

169
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,200
And if you start asking, is it random for
our being?

170
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,090
That does not obey the laws of physics of
our universe.

171
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:46,510
So this is outside our universe, so
comtemplating many universes,

172
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,310
well, we cannot say much about that.

173
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:53,430
But in our universe, for you and for me
and for all human beings, the

174
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,580
violation of Bell inequalities of quantum
physics

175
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,900
implies intrinsic in the sense of
irreducible randomness.

176
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,100
A last point I want to make before moving
to quantum information

177
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:08,070
is that the violation of Bell inequalities
is what we call device independent.

178
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:11,620
For that I want to stress that contrary to
what I did in the previous lecture

179
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,910
I did not describe the devices inside the
boxes.

180
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,550
Remember, in the previous lecture, I have
beam

181
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,030
splitters, I have photons and neutrons and
so on.

182
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,750
Okay, here I didn't speak about beam
splitters, I didn't speak about

183
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,900
detectors, I just spoke of, there's an
input and there's an output.

184
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,920
That's the power of the Bell inequalities,
that

185
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,030
you don't have to specify how to do it.

186
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,920
Of course, If you have an experiment that
is in

187
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,460
a lab that you want to set up such an
experiment,

188
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,580
then you need to know a lot.

189
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,150
You need to know how to create what is
called quantum entanglement

190
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:46,820
between these two photons or two ions or
two atoms or whatever.

191
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,370
They must be created in a particular
configuration

192
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,440
with particular properties You need to
know which

193
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,700
beam splitters to use, which detectors to
use, how to align the beams and so on.

194
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,280
Yes there is a lot of technical skills
involved.

195
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,850
It's not plug-and-play.

196
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,290
It's not a Lego blocks.

197
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,850
But if you want to asses the violation of
Bell inequalities, if you

198
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:11,860
want to just check that there was
intrinsic randomness in that set up, this

199
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,380
can be done by any one of us with a little
bit of knowledge

200
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,500
of statistics, if you can compute
probabilities

201
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,760
and check the violation of Bell
inequalities.

202
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,380
So in this sense, the assessment of
intrinsic randomness is really

203
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,700
black box, or as we like to call it,
device independent.

204
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,050
We don't need to specify if it's photons
or atoms or ions,

205
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,380
what kind of measurement, what kind of

206
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,470
beam splitters or other devices are used
inside.

207
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,380
It can be assessed in a completely blind
way.
