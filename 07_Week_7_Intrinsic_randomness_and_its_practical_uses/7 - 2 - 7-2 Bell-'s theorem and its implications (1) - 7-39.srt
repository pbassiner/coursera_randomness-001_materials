1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:06,410
So, having seen that some abilities can be
achieved

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,840
with a pre-established agreement and some
others not, I'm going to present to you

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:16,440
the correct theorem that allows to
discriminate between the 2 possibilities.-

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,500
So here is our assumption.
It is the fact that for every

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,560
call, Alice and Bob in their box, in their
laboratory,

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,200
in their room, wherever they are, they
know how

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:35,490
to reply if they get the input 0 or 1.

8
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,390
And these numbers a0, a1, b0 and b1 are
always either plus 1 or minus 1.

9
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,654
So this is the assumption: the
per-established agreement means

10
00:00:45,654 --> 00:00:51,294
that for each call, the 4 outcomes a0, a1,
the [UNKNOWN] 2 and b0,

11
00:00:51,294 --> 00:00:55,600
b1, the 2 for [INAUDIBLE] are
predetermined.

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,100
They are preexisting.

13
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,036
They are already written somewhere or they
could be written somewhere.

14
00:01:00,036 --> 00:01:04,390
In order to [UNKNOWN] theorem, we start
with simple algebra.

15
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,510
So here is again our assumption.

16
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,380
If you have these 4 numbers, if these 4
numbers are written somewhere on a piece

17
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:16,510
of paper or on 2 pieces of paper, it would
be possible to compute

18
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,860
the number S defined like that, is the
product of a0 and

19
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,810
b0 plus the product of a0 and b1 plus the
product of

20
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,330
a1 and b0 minus the product of a1 and b1.

21
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:34,990
It may be not natural why this number, but
it's certainly something you can compute.

22
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,800
And in fact it's very simple to compute
this number, because this number is either

23
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,890
plus 2 or minus 2 for all possible values
of a0, a1, b0, and b1.

24
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,410
Let us prove it.

25
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,580
By trivial algebra, you can regroup the
terms in a way that S is written

26
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,580
now in that way.
And now there are 2 possibilities.

27
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,440
Either b0 is equal to b1, or b0 is equal
to minus b1.

28
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,860
If b0 is equal to b1, the second term is
0.

29
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,170
The first term is just plus or minus 1,
whatever a0

30
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,430
is, times plus or minus 2, whatever b0 and
b1 are.

31
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,210
So this is plus 2 or minus 2.

32
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,610
And of course symmetrically, if b0 is
equal

33
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,070
to minus b1, it's the first term that is 0
and the second term that is plus or minus

34
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:25,330
1 times plus or minus 2.
So this particular number is a complicated

35
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:31,810
way to write plus 2 or minus 2 as a
function of a0, a1, b0, and b1.

36
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,320
Assuming that all these numbers are
predetermined.

37
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:40,780
Now we are facing a small problem, is that
in each call, Alice can choose only

38
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,340
one input, either x equals 0 or x equals
1.

39
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,170
And she will get only a0 or only a1, the
same for Bob.

40
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,240
So it is impossible for us to measure S on
each

41
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,260
call, because to measure S, we would need
All 4 numbers.

42
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,200
But what is interesting is that it is
possible

43
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,140
to measure the average of S over many
calls.

44
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,290
And this is because the average of a sum
is the sum of the averages.

45
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,360
If you don't find it obvious, just think a

46
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,160
little bit, and you will realize that it
is obvious.

47
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,810
For instance, the Average in a series of
exams,

48
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,610
of all your exams, of a class, you can

49
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,150
compute either the average per student and
then compute

50
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,340
the average of all of the class of that
number.

51
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,460
Or you can compute the average for each

52
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,569
exam and then again average of all the
students.

53
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:32,920
So the

54
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,920
average of S is the sum of the average of
a0b0 plus the

55
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,800
one of a0b1 plus the one of a1b0 minus the
average of a1b1.

56
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:45,230
And now, the average of a0b0 is nothing
else than the average of the product

57
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:50,750
a times b over all the cases where x was 0
and y was 0.

58
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,280
And these I think, are possible
experimental situations.

59
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,858
And so on for the others.
And now another observation.

60
00:03:58,858 --> 00:04:01,340
This one is even more trivial than the
previous one, that

61
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:06,700
the average of S must be smaller than 2
for pre-established agreement.

62
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:06,963
Why?

63
00:04:06,963 --> 00:04:10,197
Well, remember that S for pre-established
agreement is

64
00:04:10,197 --> 00:04:12,414
either plus 2 or minus 2 all the time.

65
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,890
And if you take an average of a number
that can only be plus 2 or minus 2.

66
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:24,840
You cannot possibly go above 2.
So here's Bell's theorem.

67
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,436
Yes, the famous Bell's theorem is nothing
else than this.

68
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:31,412
It's that pre-established agreement.

69
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,955
implies that this number S on average must
be smaller than 2.

70
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,970
It's called Bell's theorem because the
first such inequality.

71
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,630
You see that this is smaller or equal, so
that's why it's

72
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,870
an inequality was derived by John Bell, an
Irish physicist, in 1964.

73
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,025
The presentation

74
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:54,860
I followed here is the one by Clauser,
Home,Shimony and Holt.

75
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:01,180
In 1969, it's called CHSH, by now it's the
most famous of these Bell inequalities.

76
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,310
What is important to stress, and I will
stress it a few

77
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,490
times, is that this average value of S is
a measurable number.

78
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,140
You put inputs, get outputs, and compute
averages.

79
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,145
So it's something you can check.

80
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:15,890
And now the

81
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,940
logical converse of Bell's theorem, so
just reversing, writing the not,

82
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,100
of, the negation, of the statement, is
that, if one would

83
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,480
would observe that S is larger than 2,
which is a

84
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,370
violation of the Bell inequality, because
S should be smaller than 2.

85
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,008
If you find that S is larger than

86
00:05:35,008 --> 00:05:38,630
2, then pre-established agreement cannot
be the explanation.

87
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,940
And quantum theory

88
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,750
does predict a violation for suitable
experiments.

89
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,940
And the experiments once realized,
confirmed

90
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,565
the violation is there in nature.

91
00:05:49,565 --> 00:05:50,570
Well, this is an important point.

92
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:55,340
So you can't only just check the theory.
You have to check that nature does it.

93
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,914
And again, it can be checked because this
S is a measurable number.

94
00:05:59,914 --> 00:06:00,840
Here is an example.

95
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,520
Lets take our game that I discussed in the
previous segment.

96
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,460
The, the game where Alice and Bob have to

97
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:12,330
output the same.
Unless they both received the setting, 1.

98
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,950
So what is the ideal case?

99
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:20,325
The ideal case is that when x and y are 0
and 0, a and

100
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:25,390
b must be equal, so the product ab must be
+1.

101
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:31,077
Similarly, when x is 0 and y is 1, x and y
and y Is 0.

102
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:32,493
When x is 1 and

103
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:37,910
y is 1, a and b must be different.
So the problem might be minus 1.

104
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:44,910
Now plug these 4 numbers into our S value
and you find 4.

105
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:52,170
4 is larger than 2.
This confirms what we had already guessed

106
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:57,650
before with our more intuitive argument
that again, same output unless x is equal

107
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:01,090
to, y is equal to 1, cannot be achieved
with preestablished agreement.

108
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,810
I want to make a remark that something I

109
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,330
mentioned before, that quantum systems
cannot win this game perfectly.

110
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,814
So this kind of correlations, this kind of

111
00:07:10,814 --> 00:07:14,860
statistics cannot be made even with
quantum physics.

112
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,040
But, quantum physics can reach in a
approximate version of this game, can

113
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,450
reach a value of S that is 2 times square
root of 2,

114
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:27,640
which is 2.83, which is a clear violation
anyway.

115
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,740
So now that we have the bending equality,
we don't need to win this game perfectly.

116
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,500
We can just check the inequalities
violated.

117
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,901
And, quantum physics, quantum theory can
violate the inequality only after 2.83.
