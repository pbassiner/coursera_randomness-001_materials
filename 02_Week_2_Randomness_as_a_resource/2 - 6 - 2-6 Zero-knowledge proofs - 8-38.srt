1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:06,900
We finish with something that is between a
game and

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:12,140
cryptography, in the sense that you see
it's a sort of game, but in which the

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:17,470
partners don't trust each other.
Topic of zero-knowledge proofs.

4
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,410
Here is the task.

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,280
Alice is a PhD student.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,590
And she claims she has found the proof of
a fantastic theorem.

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,380
She wants to go to a conference to present
it, and

8
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,639
needs the approval of her supervisor, Bob.

9
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,340
Bob of course wants to check that Alice's
claim

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,180
is motivated and wants to learn about the
proof.

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,020
But Alice is reluctant to reveal the proof
to Bob

12
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,330
because the theorem is really important,
and she fears that

13
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,650
Bob upon hearing it just will go to his
computer,

14
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,610
type the proof, send it himself, and get
all the credit.

15
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,480
So the question

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,730
is, can Alice convince Bob that she has a
proof

17
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,990
without showing the actual proof to Bob.
So here's the goal.

18
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,680
Alice wants to convince Bob that she knows

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,570
the proof without showing the proof to
Bob.

20
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,630
Notice how this scenario's different.

21
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,560
From the secret communication we had
before.

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,070
On the one hand Alice and Bob now don't
trust each other.

23
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,480
On the other had

24
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,010
there is no Eve.

25
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,010
Alice and Bob don't need to be at a
distance.

26
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,200
They can be in the same room discussing in
the office of the supervisor.

27
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,800
The fact, the fact that this is possible

28
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,990
is based on a particular kind of
mathematical problem.

29
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,640
It's called three-coloring.
So let me show first.

30
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,780
That Alice can convince Bob that she has
proof of three coloring.

31
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,572
The question is,you

32
00:01:42,572 --> 00:01:49,030
have a graph, like the ones shown here,
planar graph, just on a piece of paper.

33
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,120
Can a graph be colored with only three
colors

34
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,780
by making sure that two connected notes
have different colors?

35
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,700
You may know that this part applies us to
maps

36
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,460
of the world, and you know that in
general, you

37
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,310
need need four colors to color a map in
such

38
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,550
a way that two neighboring countries don't
have the same color.

39
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,670
But for some particular pieces of the map,
it may be possible to use three colors.

40
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,120
So that's the question.

41
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,520
And you see the two graphs I have here,
and

42
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,780
of course very simple and we'll use them
for illustration.

43
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,540
The first one is obviously three

44
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,690
colorable, the second one is obviously
not.

45
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,190
But of course if they give you a very
complicated graph, its not easy in fact

46
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,870
this, NP and even what people got NP

47
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,450
complete, to find out if given graph is
three

48
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,150
colorable or not.

49
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,150
The observation we are going to use for
the

50
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,640
zero knowledge proof, is that there is
obvious symmetry.

51
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,770
Each 3-coloring comes in six versions, six
permutations.

52
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,190
So here is the coloring I had before, and
clearly I can change

53
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,100
for isntance, here I kept the red but
again exchanged green and yellow.

54
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,986
I still get a valid 3-coloring.

55
00:02:55,986 --> 00:02:58,010
Or here, I can change

56
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,120
yellow and red, still get a valid
3-coloring.

57
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,840
And so on.

58
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,130
And as you know there are six permutations
of this problem.

59
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,930
So, what is the goal again, okay, Alice

60
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,690
has found out there 3-coloring of the
graph and

61
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,400
wants to convince Bob that she has indeed

62
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,960
found it, but without revealing the
solution to Bob.

63
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,240
So she'll do the following.

64
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,930
Here is a sheet of paper in which the
graph

65
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,320
which has been drawn and Alice comes to
Bob's office and

66
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,490
says Look, I have the 3-coloring of this
graph.

67
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,730
Bob wants to be convinced.

68
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,460
Alice is keeping the real solution secret.

69
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,410
What she does is to hide, without Bob
watching,

70
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,030
her real solution under the blank piece of
paper.

71
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:45,550
And then ask Bob to unveil two out of the
four many notes.

72
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,410
For instance, Bob may ask, well I want to
see one and four.

73
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:52,710
Fair enough, you move one and four, and
you see they have different colors.

74
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,580
And then you repeat again.

75
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,080
So here is again the previous instance.

76
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,760
Hide the graph.
Reveal one and four.

77
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,793
In the second instance, Alice may choose a
different amutation.

78
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,100
She hides it.

79
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,523
Bob now is asking to see two and four.

80
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,948
Here they are.
Two and four are again different.

81
00:04:13,948 --> 00:04:17,050
But model four is different from before,

82
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,475
because Alex has used a different
permutation.

83
00:04:20,475 --> 00:04:21,399
[UNKNOWN]

84
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,930
Bob wants to see again one and four.

85
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,850
One and four are again different between
each other,

86
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,870
so it looks like the three coloring is
really there.

87
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,740
And, moreover, these two are different
from the same two in the first one.

88
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,960
You repeat this many times.

89
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,260
Now what can happen?

90
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,730
It may happen that Alice is caught at
fault at some point.

91
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,060
Okay, then she doesn't have the proof.

92
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,470
If Alice is never caught at fault after
some

93
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,730
time, Bob would sort of convinced that the
proof exists.

94
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,060
She must have the 3-coloring.

95
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,540
Of course, provided she cannot predict
which node Bob will decide

96
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,650
to look into in each hand, otherwise she
can easily cheat.

97
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,160
So here is where randomness comes into
play.

98
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,380
Alice must not be able to predict what Bob
does.

99
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,460
It means Bob must choose which nodes to
reveal at random.

100
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,660
Bob, in turn will not learn how

101
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,530
to draw the graph.

102
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,280
He cannot go back to his office and
publish the

103
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,100
proof unless he can predict which nodes
correspond to which permutation,

104
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,174
in which case he can solve out the
different nodes

105
00:05:21,174 --> 00:05:25,120
according to the permutations and come up
with a consistent coloring.

106
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,320
Here again, randomness.

107
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,260
Alice must choose a permutation at random.

108
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:33,010
Now you may, now you may ask, fair enough,
okay amazing, we

109
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:37,050
find how to prove zero knowledge proof for
3-coloring, what if Alice's

110
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,868
proof is not about 3-coloring?

111
00:05:38,868 --> 00:05:42,115
If, if it's about a math theorem, if it's
about the

112
00:05:42,115 --> 00:05:42,472
[UNKNOWN]

113
00:05:42,472 --> 00:05:45,120
conjecture or something else Here I cannot
go into

114
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,180
many details although the proofs are not
very difficult.

115
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:52,590
You will find them in an advanced computer
science book if you want to learn them.

116
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,620
But this is the idea.

117
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,400
The idea is a statement I have a proof of
theorem of length

118
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,230
n can be mapped to a, in a complicated
way, but systematic way.

119
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:06,640
And if the proof is correct, the graph is
graph is 3-colorable.

120
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,650
And if and only if,

121
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,230
in fact.
How is the argument of that one?

122
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,810
Well, first of all, notice that having a
proof

123
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,880
of a theorem is of length n is NP problem.

124
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,030
How do you prove that?

125
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,596
There is a formal proof, but you can do it
intuitively.

126
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:20,021
You know that

127
00:06:20,021 --> 00:06:20,520
[INAUDIBLE]

128
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,690
has to find the proof but it's easy to
check a proof.

129
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,690
Is may, you might have felt this in

130
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,480
your mathematics lecture when the
professor states a theorem.

131
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,930
It's very obscure, how would I prove it?
Then, the professor goes to the proof.

132
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,310
And you check it, and the app makes sense.

133
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,150
So this is a exact definition of an NP
problem.

134
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:43,320
Hard to find the solution, but if someone
gives you the solution, you can check it.

135
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,930
And, now there is another theorem in
1970s.

136
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:50,000
Again, not a very difficult one by
Cook-Levin, that said the following.

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,370
Any NP problem can be solved If one can
solve one of the NP complete problems.

138
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,140
And 3-colorable is one of these problems.

139
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,460
That's in fact the definition of NP

140
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,400
complete or a consequence of the
definition.

141
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,260
An NP complete problem is a problem such
that if you

142
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,910
have it's solution you have the solution
to all possible NP problems.

143
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:08,390
That's the idea.

144
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,980
So essentially from if you have zero n
proof

145
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,820
for 3-coloring, in principle you have a

146
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,300
zero n proof for any possible mathematical
theorem.

147
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,060
I have a cryptographic remark on it.

148
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,520
Remember what we said that this kind of
proof relies

149
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,060
on Alice choosing a permutation before
learning about Bob's choices.

150
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,070
It's called commitment.

151
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,926
Of course, if Alice can chose a
permutatioin after learning

152
00:07:29,926 --> 00:07:33,810
about Bob's choice, or knowing Bob's
choices, she can cheat.

153
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,170
And Bob must, the goal is that zero
knowledge,

154
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:40,250
the goal is that Bob must not learn which
permutation is being chosen in each run.

155
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:44,380
This can be easily guaranteed if you do it
"in person".

156
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,410
In an office, and you have the pieces of
paper that I was mentioning before.

157
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,960
You move them around, and you see that
though

158
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,430
I hide it before you look, and so on.

159
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,990
But if you want to do it within two
communicating

160
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,380
machines, it requires something, a
communication primitive called bit commit.

161
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,390
And bit commitment is not easy to
implement.

162
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,250
In fact, it cannot be implemented
unconditionally,

163
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,280
like the one-time pad.

164
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,850
It can only be implemented under
computational assumptions.

165
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,230
With these, we finish our second lecture
in which I hope to have

166
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:14,170
convinced you that unpredictability is not
always a nuisance, it can be a resource.

167
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,330
We have seen some tasks in which
randomness plays a role.

168
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:22,090
We spent some time discussing randomized
algorithms and the fact that maybe

169
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:26,080
randomization in that case is not useful
at the end of the day.

170
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,130
And then finally we discuss cryptography,

171
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,270
which are games where there are untrusted
parties,

172
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,580
and therefore we must guarantee that the,
some,

173
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,480
there is some randomness, some ignorance
of the

174
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,260
untrusted party in order to perform the
task.

175
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,220
See you next week.
