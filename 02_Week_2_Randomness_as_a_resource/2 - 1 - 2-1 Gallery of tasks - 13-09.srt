1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,750
Hello welcome to the second lecture.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,890
Last week we have studied the definition
of Randomness.

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:11,110
This week we are going to see how
randomness can be a resource.

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,640
The plan of the lecture first the main
message, that

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,130
I've already announced, that
unpredictability,

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,880
randomness is not always a nuisance.

7
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,800
It can be a resource for some tasks.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,490
Louie stopped in the first segment by
presenting a few of this tasks,

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,550
not in great detail, but just to give an
idea that

10
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:33,103
indeed its not absurd to think that
randomness is a resource.

11
00:00:33,103 --> 00:00:35,975
Then second segment is devoted to
computational complexity.

12
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:39,790
These are some mathematical notions and
tools, that I have to

13
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:44,060
introduce in order to continue speaking,
in a more informed way.

14
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,140
The first segment is devoted to randomized
algorithms.

15
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,490
It's one of those task in which randomness
is supposed to help, or maybe not.

16
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:55,250
We're going to discover the debate that
has happened around this task.

17
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,540
The fourth and fifth segment are devoted
to Cryptography, one of them most

18
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,680
important applications of randomness or
secrecy is

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,750
guaranteed by the ignorance of the
adversary.

20
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,860
And the sixth segment would be something
very special because your knowledge proofs

21
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,530
is a bit mind boggling and, I hope you
will be interested by it.

22
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,518
So, let us move to the, to the beginning
of

23
00:01:16,518 --> 00:01:21,680
this lecture.
It is a fast gallery of tasks in which

24
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,440
randomness is used.
These tasks can be divided in two classes.

25
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,810
Essentially according to the role of
randomness.

26
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,860
In many of these tasks, randomness is only
meant as lack of structure.

27
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:41,520
For instance, in sampling, for polls, you
sample a population, you want to sample at

28
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,910
random to make sure that you don't
introduce a bias

29
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,320
that would create problems in the
assessment, in the statistics.

30
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,680
Also, other tasks we are going to see in
the fur,

31
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,540
in the coming slides are what is called
Monte Carlo computation.

32
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,620
Monte Carlo is the name of the mountain,
of

33
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,160
the rock on which the casino in Monaco is
built.

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,610
And these task relate to optimization, to
software testing,

35
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,170
and also to these randomized algorithms
that

36
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,420
will be the object of the next segment.

37
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:14,880
And then, other tasks for which randomness

38
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,140
is used mostly because of secrecy or
ignorance.

39
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,460
And these tasks essentially the games.

40
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,630
In this case apart from cryptography that
would be a

41
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:28,300
big topic later, games in which randomness
guarantees that, fairness.

42
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,670
That players have all the same information
and not too much.

43
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,190
The first example of Monte Carlo method is
Optimization.

44
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,080
Optimization means to find the maximum
value of a function.

45
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,030
A function of many variables and the
function can be very complex.

46
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:51,080
Indeed this function can have many local
maxima and minima, many

47
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,650
peaks, many valleys, but we want to find
the global max.

48
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,610
The one that is really the highest peak.

49
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,300
Without randomness,

50
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,010
what will you do?

51
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,400
Well you can arrange a pre-established
grade on

52
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,020
your set of points and check the function.

53
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,730
Sample the function in those
pre-established

54
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,104
points or in some pre-established
directions.

55
00:03:14,104 --> 00:03:15,370
And then you would keep the maximum

56
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,150
value With randomness, something else can
be done.

57
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,320
You can stop from a point.

58
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,959
At this point you study the variation

59
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,740
of the functioning various directions, and

60
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,300
then, you're choosing which direction to
move.

61
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,620
But you choose at random which direction
to move with suitable probabilities.

62
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,780
Of course, most of the time, you would

63
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,320
try to move in the direction where the
function

64
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,200
increases But these may not be the case,
and

65
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,710
then you'll go to the next point and
repeat.

66
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,030
What is the advantage of this method?

67
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,850
Just think that for instance that you go
back to other terministic

68
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,000
case without randomness, where you move
always in the direction where the

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,690
function increases.

70
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:56,880
Then for sure or almost for sure, you will
end up stuck in a local max.

71
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,032
Because once you're having the local

72
00:03:58,032 --> 00:04:00,320
maximum function, the doesn't increase
anymore.

73
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,720
In the neighborhood and you stopped there.

74
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,080
However, with randomness, it's actually
possible to get unstuck to go down

75
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,280
from a local maximum to follow a direction
which the function decreases.

76
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,404
So this is the advantage of randomness

77
00:04:15,404 --> 00:04:17,840
in this Monte Carlo method for musicians
are used

78
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,240
a lot in computation of physics and many
other tasks.

79
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:26,020
Another Monte Carlo method is testing a
complex software.

80
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,880
For instance, airplane control.

81
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:34,080
Suppose that you want to test the software
that is going to work in the air plane.

82
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,285
That are going to, to control in all
possible conditions.

83
00:04:37,285 --> 00:04:40,450
Without randomness you should ask a team

84
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,030
of engineers to list all possible
emergency

85
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,320
situations that they can think of, and
then

86
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,140
you test the software, and you check if

87
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,470
the software can go with those emergency
situations.

88
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,510
With randomness, you just create
situations at random.

89
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,810
And see if the software can cope with
them.

90
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,270
What is the advantage here?
Well the advantage is clear.

91
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:02,660
Thee randomness helps not to rely on the
human

92
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,790
on human perception of what is likely to
happen.

93
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,160
That maybe a crazy bug in the software,
that non-engineer

94
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,250
will come about with, and however is, bug
is really serious.

95
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,310
If you sample at random all possible
situations, with a

96
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,620
very high pro, with a very high
probability, you will find.

97
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,150
Now this actually happens.

98
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,990
And the fact that our airplanes are very,

99
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,170
very safe is a proof that randomness is
useful.

100
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:27,850
Gambling.

101
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,930
Well, gambling is a very kind of special
activity.

102
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,440
Many studies have been devoted to it.

103
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,000
various activities in fact, go under the
notion of gambling.

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,640
Dart games, the famous cards, dice
roulette, the Asian contest of

105
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,320
pachinko in Japan, mahjong in the Chinese
world, oh there is activity of betting.

106
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,750
Betting on sports.

107
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,850
Betting on horses.
Betting on other situations of real life.

108
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,700
In gambling, randomness is seen

109
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,490
as ignorance.
So ignorance implies fairness.

110
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,670
And neither the client, nor the house have
privileged knowledge.

111
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,920
They're not suppose to have privileged
knowledge.

112
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,820
In this situation please remember that the
house wins on average.

113
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,570
So almost all the time.
If someone wins at the casino.

114
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,870
Is really by chance.

115
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,070
By a lucky strike.

116
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,090
But then, in on average, the house wins
all the time.

117
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,070
Odds are set in a way that the casino
doesn't lose.

118
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,020
Please remember this.

119
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,370
Now, of course there are plenty of
examples in the, where this fallacy is not

120
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:39,640
in place, and there have been soccer game
fixed, and all these kinds of problem.

121
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,400
Let me mention just two famous noncriminal
cases where the

122
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,945
house of a casino was broken by some smart
gambler.

123
00:06:48,945 --> 00:06:52,310
Only the most famous example in history is
the one of Joseph Jagger,

124
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,190
an Englishman who went to Monaco, to Monte
Carlo, the casino mentioned before.

125
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:01,480
And in 1873, he noticed that one of the
roulette was not

126
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,110
a fair roulette.

127
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,790
Some numbers would come up more often than
others.

128
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,610
And they started betting on those numbers
and of course, they won a lot.

129
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,340
And there's a whole story there on how the
casino tried to change the roulette

130
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,690
of table and he noticed so he moved to the
other table and so on.

131
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,480
Another famous example, obviously some
movies or some

132
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,340
books about this is the MIT Blackjack
team.

133
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,760
These were a few people who were very good
with memory

134
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,540
with mathematics and they went to a
blackjack table and

135
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,840
managed to remember very well which cards
had been played.

136
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,380
And if you have that information, if you
managed to store

137
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,290
in your brain Which gambling you play, you
get an advantage.

138
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,210
Then again, there are many stories about

139
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:41,260
[UNKNOWN]

140
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,240
you can read about.

141
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,480
But these are just to show that these are
the cases where it's not

142
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,090
that the houses, cheating is not really

143
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,240
cheating, there are some people are using
addtional

144
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,860
information that the house have not
noticed, like in the case of the casino

145
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:01,390
Of might of Joseph Jagger, because he had
not noticed that roulette was a betrayed.

146
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,710
He noticed it and he could win.

147
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,740
That's where the lack of randomness, a bit
of knowledge

148
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,360
helps in changing the rules of the game.

149
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:16,450
Apart from gambling, randomness is also
useful in many other games,

150
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:20,380
those that are characterize under the
general feature of game theory.

151
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,415
Here is an example, the famous rock,
paper, and scissor game, where rock,

152
00:08:25,415 --> 00:08:31,880
paper, scissor defeat each other, and as
you know, the best strategy for

153
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,360
each player is to throw each of their
choices at random with probability 1 3rd.

154
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:36,940
Why is it so?

155
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,780
Well, because if a player starts deviating
from the

156
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,760
strategy, and starts playing lets say rock
more often.

157
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,400
Then, the other player may start noticing
it, because at

158
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,710
this exchange he start playing paper more
often, that's winning.

159
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,100
So, you know, not to lose, as you know,
this game cannot be won.

160
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,908
But in order not to lose the best study is
just to draw each of the

161
00:08:56,908 --> 00:08:59,580
player possibilities as random probability
of 1/3.

162
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,360
This is an example of what is called the
Nash equilibrium which is

163
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,910
presented as strategy from which each the
players do not want to deviate.

164
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,990
And this Nash equilibrium is mixed.

165
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:15,820
Mixed meaning precisely that it uses
randomness, The gaming itself may

166
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:22,510
sound a bit silly, but it can be used to
model this one or other ones similar ones,

167
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:25,480
very many situations in human and animal
behavior.

168
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:31,120
This leads us to another consideration
that will be done in the next slide.

169
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,660
The question is where is the randomness?

170
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,370
You can think of individuals, playing a
mixed strategy

171
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,680
like one in just described with rock,
paper, and scissors.

172
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,490
In terms of time.

173
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,140
And, you will think that the individuals
have really random choices.

174
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,510
So, here's an individual.

175
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,830
The circles split in three.

176
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:54,300
And that, in each arm, each individual
takes a decision.

177
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:54,980
And chooses.

178
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,304
Here, one of the newestchosen scissors,
the other has

179
00:09:59,304 --> 00:10:03,538
chosen rock and the rock wins over the
scissors.

180
00:10:03,538 --> 00:10:08,670
The next run, the players change decision.

181
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,200
One chooses paper, the other chooses rock,
and now continues to choose rock.

182
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,930
It's a possible

183
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,300
random decision to keep what you have.

184
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,965
And as a result the, the paper one now
wins.

185
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:25,590
This is supposed to mean that every play
here each time can choose its random.

186
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,002
Now theres a different situation though
that

187
00:10:30,002 --> 00:10:34,360
this random populations play a mixed
strategy.

188
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,740
You can have a situation like this one.

189
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,960
This drawing is meant to mean that

190
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,980
each individual is always playing the same
strategy.

191
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,670
The first two on the upper left corner,

192
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:50,920
the first individual, is playing always
scissor, the second is

193
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,170
always playing rock, as a result, the
second always wins.

194
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:55,610
And so on.

195
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,540
Here you see all these individuals.

196
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,630
So the two populations of the column on
the left, the column

197
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:03,044
on the right some are winning, some are
losing, some are just

198
00:11:03,044 --> 00:11:05,284
[INAUDIBLE]

199
00:11:05,284 --> 00:11:09,084
.The statistics of these

200
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:13,860
realization is the same as the one of the
individual case.

201
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:20,290
So here, randomness is not individual but
in the sampling.

202
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,710
What does it mean in terms of biology, in
terms of genetics?

203
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,100
It means that the population may have

204
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,960
varying traits, something that determines
their behaviors that

205
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:37,040
is not obvious but each animal, let's say,
behaves in a given way.

206
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,730
So for instance, this particular animal
always very aggressive.

207
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,590
This other particular animal is always
very quiet.

208
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,930
But on average, the population has the

209
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,280
right fraction of aggressive animals and
quiet animals.

210
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:57,620
This is a very important slide.
We have to think about this problem.

211
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,370
Because, here we have the same statistical
conclusions,

212
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,020
and a different implications in terms of
randomness.

213
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:09,449
Ultimately, it can bee seen as the bond
between free will and determinism.

214
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,630
Let me put it like this, does a crab

215
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:20,210
or any other animal choose at random its
behavior?

216
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:26,965
Or is it the case that each graph has a
better mind behavior and only, on another

217
00:12:26,965 --> 00:12:27,854
[INAUDIBLE]

218
00:12:27,854 --> 00:12:31,170
of the population, you see the correct
statistics?

219
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,310
For the game to succeed, for the
equilibrium

220
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,240
to be reached, for the populations not to
disappear.

221
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,910
Of course reality's much more complex than
these games as with the

222
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,630
games I showed here, because there is
feedback, there is adaptive behavior.

223
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,450
It's known that some animals may stop
being aggressive.

224
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,780
Now, so, sometimes they see that they are
losing a lot.

225
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,960
Maybe they back up a little bit.

226
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,880
And so, it's not as simple, but the point
I want to make

227
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,810
is, the difference between the statistics
that actually that

228
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,210
are acheived by each individual playing a
random stratagy

229
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:04,640
verses, the whole population, playing
deterministically but with different

230
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,130
rates, and actually knock statistics out
of the sampling.
