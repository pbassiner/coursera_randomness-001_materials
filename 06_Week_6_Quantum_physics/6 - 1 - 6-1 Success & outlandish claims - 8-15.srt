1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:03,750
Welcome to this 6th lecture, that is the

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,670
first one of two devoted to quantum
physics.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,530
Here is the plan of the lecture, in which
I hope

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,950
to introduce you to some phenomena that
described by quantum physics.

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,200
They're your first examples of quantum
phenomena.

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,200
In the first segment I will just mention
what

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,930
is quantum physics, and all the successes
it scored.

8
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,460
And some claims that I call outlandish.

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,460
Some of the changes in our world view that
are carried over by this theory.

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,930
Then, in the next segment, I will describe
two types of phenomena of interference.

11
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,710
One called Mach-Zehnder interferometer,
the

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,310
other called the double-slit
interferometer.

13
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,310
And finally I will wrap up this first
lecture by

14
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,910
discussing what kind of randomness have we
seen in these phenomena.

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,900
So let us start with the success of
quantum physics, and

16
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,260
the claims that this theory makes.
A quick history first.

17
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,310
It all started with people observing
phenomena.

18
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,360
That define a description with classical
physics.

19
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,060
Classical remember as we said in

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,230
the previous lecture, it means Newtonian
physics.

21
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,080
The physics before the 20th century.

22
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,930
This phenomena the observation of spectral
lines of emission and

23
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,510
absorption by atoms.
The famous Balmer lines, for instance.

24
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,740
The observation what's called the
Black-body radiation,

25
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,390
and what is called the photoelectric
effect.

26
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,090
I'm not going to enter into details of
what these are, because

27
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,390
I'm going to focus on other phenomena
simpler that had been noticed later.

28
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,170
Of course you can find all the details on
the internet.

29
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,570
To discover this phenomena this take us

30
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,030
the development of few partial models was
called

31
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,520
old quantum theory.

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,530
That's all patchwork where everybody tries
to address a

33
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,910
different problem and succeeds in solving
that particular problem.

34
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,780
Not many others.

35
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:56,300
So in 1900 Planck makes his famous
mathematical assumption that he

36
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,800
doesn't understand physically, but he
makes it and he proves it.

37
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,890
With that he can explain the black body
radiation.

38
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,710
In 1905 Einstein takes the same assumption

39
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,280
as Planck would explain the photoelectric
effect.

40
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,270
And in 1913, Miss Bohr comes up with a

41
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,980
model for hydrogen atom that explains the
spectral lines.

42
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,700
Then in 1926, after many other attempts.

43
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,170
A few people, Schrodinger, Heisenberg,
Born, Dirac and others

44
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,360
come up with what we call now quantum
theory.

45
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,334
In the [INAUDIBLE] and the mathematics are
still the same.

46
00:02:28,334 --> 00:02:31,180
Even if of course there have been a lot of
developments.

47
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,868
Some of the predictions of quantum
physics.

48
00:02:33,868 --> 00:02:34,640
One can,

49
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,420
roughly say that traditional quantum
physics deals with atoms and light.

50
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,690
So when it comes to atoms, you can
consider the physics

51
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:46,150
of one single atom, you can look into the
nucleus, and

52
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,420
then quantum physics explains
radioactivity,

53
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,170
another of, another phenomenon that was

54
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,080
discovered towards the end of the 19th
century that was unexplained.

55
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,570
It explains nuclear power.

56
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,710
It explains the sub-nuclear particles or
that is called

57
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,100
high energy physics of the [INAUDIBLE]

58
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,630
Higgs boson that was discovered very
recently.

59
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,210
And when one looks not at the nucleus of
the one

60
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,170
atom but the electrons, one can explain in
particular all these

61
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,750
spectral lines, that are observed in the
mission of the life

62
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,300
of the stars and was from some lamps also
here on earth.

63
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,980
If you consider more atoms, then quantum
physics code becomes much more broader.

64
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,160
Quantum physics explains molecules, why
two atoms of oxygen

65
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,190
like to come together to form the molecule
O2.

66
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,075
And in fact the quantum physics is at the
basic, bases of all of chemistry.

67
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:43,180
If one considers all the arrays of many
atoms like solids.

68
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,040
Quantum physics helps explaining sorry
does explain essentially is

69
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,300
the tool for condensed matter physics,
which explains why

70
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,830
some materials are conductors and others
semiconductors, some are insulators.

71
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,300
Why there is magnetism, super conductivity
and so on.

72
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,980
They have left light there in a corner.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,020
Light itself is described by quantum
physics.

74
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,610
It's called quantum optics or quantum
electro-dynamics

75
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,920
and in the interaction between light and
atoms.

76
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,030
One explains not only the photoelectric
effect, the

77
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,330
original one, but many other things and
phenomena of

78
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,930
such things and in particular the laser is
a product of that development.

79
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,630
But there's much more.

80
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:27,160
So, this is just an idea of how successful
this new approach to physics is.

81
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,610
Then you can legitimately ask, if it
explains

82
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,760
so many things and, in fact, quite a

83
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,010
few things of those are useful in our
world and used very much like the laser.

84
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,150
Why don't we learn this in high school?

85
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,580
Well because there is a price to pay.

86
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,500
Sometimes when he has this kind of
explanation that

87
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,400
a theory is very abstract, or it's too
mathematical.

88
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:52,600
I don't really believe in these
explanations because at the end of the day

89
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,100
the mathematics are, yes, a little bit

90
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,720
advanced, but are not extremely
complicated either.

91
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,569
One could learn them by making the effort.

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,100
The ultimate reason that I will try to
discuss during this whole lecture

93
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,850
and the next is that, quantum physics is
difficult because it relies on intrinsic

94
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:13,110
randomness and this means that you can't
make an image of what happens.

95
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,390
By the way, this is the reason why indeed
the [UNKNOWN] of quantum

96
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,490
physics, if you open one of them at
random, you would find you need.

97
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,350
Out of focus on the mathematics, because
its hard to

98
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,360
give image or give intuition of what is
going on.

99
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,710
Little by little many people are making an

100
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:32,130
effort to make, to make quantum physics
more approachable,

101
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,120
but it's totally traditional treatise is
the ones

102
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,650
I studied for instance, they ask the
mathematics.

103
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,270
But the reason is not the mathematical
complication, the reason is

104
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,390
really the presence of intrinsic
randomness

105
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,800
that makes the description very hard.

106
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,190
So here are some quantum buzzwords related
to intrinsic atoms in one way or another.

107
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,540
Unpredicability, you cannot predict the
outcome

108
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,950
of each measurement, only it's
probability.

109
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,660
You make repeated measurements and you can
only predict

110
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,910
how often a given outcome will appear, but
you cannot predict

111
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,579
now in this particle of measurement which
one that will observe.

112
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,520
Uncertainty, that would be better called
indetermination.

113
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,390
That not all physical properties can have
definite values at the same time.

114
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,080
We are going to discuss later this lecture
the famous example

115
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,240
of Heisenberg uncertainty relations that
position

116
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,150
and momentum cannot be known
simultaneously.

117
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:27,900
Delocalization, a particle, I will put
''particle'', can explore

118
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,720
different regions of space as if it were a
wave.

119
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,230
Where as we, of course we think of a

120
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:37,180
particle as a localized object, as a
sphere being somewhere.

121
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,300
Entanglement, this would be the object of
the next lecture where two or

122
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,990
more degrees of freedom may have only

123
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,840
common properties and not the individual
ones.

124
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,500
This sounds mysterious and now we spend a
good

125
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,600
part of the next lecture explaining it.

126
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,640
Probably unless you are familiar with
these things, at this

127
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,020
point you would say, what the hell are you
speaking about.

128
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,980
And here is the plan for what I'm going to
tell you next.

129
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,780
For the time being, it is very legitimate
to be skeptical.

130
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,800
You may ask for instance of these notions
only artifacts of the theory.

131
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,980
How can I be sure that these notions,

132
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:19,120
these [UNKNOWN] Are really there out there
in nature.

133
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,270
A point I want to stress now just to

134
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:27,360
finish is that, the word quantum itself
comes from discreteness.

135
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,850
Because indeed at the beginning, people
noticed

136
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,890
in, in this phenomenon, like the black

137
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,370
body radiation, the photoelectric effect,
and the

138
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,190
spectral lines, they noticed the
discreteness of

139
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,000
energy levels.

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,250
They notice that some physical systems
could only take some discreet values

141
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,310
for the energy whereas energy supposed to
be continuous in classical physics.

142
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,890
But this discreetness is ultimately not
very fundamental.

143
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,420
In fact, we have spent a lot of

144
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,950
time on these lectures dealing with
discrete variables.

145
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,660
The coin, head or tail, the bit.

146
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,940
And we did not feel very bad because we
are playing with the street variables.

147
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:08,480
So ultimately it's not the discreetness
that is the core of quantum physics.

148
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,630
Although again, it is very important but
is the presence of intrinsic randomness.
