1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,980
This is going to be a rather short
segment.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,610
I just want to introduce to you another

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,010
setup that also is used to show
interferences.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,250
This is called the double-slit setup and
is used in many discussions.

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,930
It is based on a different way of
splitting waves.

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:21,060
The beam splitter I showed you before
[INAUDIBLE] is called amplitude splitting.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,670
You have a wave coming in, and it splits

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,130
it in, let's say two waves of half
intensity.

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,640
The other kind of way of splitting waves
is what is called Wavefront Splitting.

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,479
The wave has it is not a localized object
in space.

11
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:43,060
It's propagating in this direction but
it's a, sort of, spatial wave like that.

12
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,255
And upon finding a slit, part of it would
be reflected,

13
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:51,848
and part of the transmitter is transformed
into, essentially, a spherical wave.

14
00:00:51,848 --> 00:00:55,320
So Young's double-slit

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,720
interferometer is based on that idea.

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,910
You have two slits, as the name indicates,
a wave impinging on them.

17
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,670
What remains of the wave are two spherical
wave that go towards

18
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,120
a stream, and in the stream

19
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,430
there will be constructive and destructive
interferences.

20
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,990
So, you will see some regions where a lot
of light is detected, some

21
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,410
amount, or a lot of particles is

22
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,620
detected and some regions where nothing is
detected.

23
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,640
Typically the intensity

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,920
profile goes something like this.
Historically these interference

25
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,150
was first reported by Thomas Young in
1803, using light.

26
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,290
And, of course, it was far before quantum
physics started.

27
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,130
In fact, it was one of the strongest
pieces of evidence that light is a

28
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,380
wave and not a particle, together with

29
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,360
something observed in France, which is
called [FOREIGN].

30
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,930
Now interestingly,

31
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,070
Young was British.

32
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,120
He presented his results in the Royal
Society,

33
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,250
and he was strongly attacked on strongly
unscientific grounds.

34
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,540
The reason was that, as you may know from
the history

35
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,680
of science, the description of light has
been controversial for many centuries.

36
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,970
And Newton, the champion of the British
Islands was

37
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:12,020
supporting the view that light is a
particle, whereas some

38
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,770
people in Europe, in the continental
Europe were

39
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,868
supporting the view that light is a wave.

40
00:02:16,868 --> 00:02:21,830
So the poor Young demonstrated that the
light is a wave in the British Islands,

41
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,450
was attacked by his peers because he

42
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,090
was attacking, in fact, the founding
father Newton.

43
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,540
Of course, at the end of the day, the
thing was peacefully

44
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,120
settled and light was considered the wave
until the Quantum Physics came.

45
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:37,432
So, where has this Young double-slit
experiment

46
00:02:37,432 --> 00:02:42,440
been observed, been performed with this
matter wave, with these particles?

47
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,650
Well, again, many with electrons, for
instance, propagating electrons,

48
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,160
this times from a electron microscope,
with atoms, atom interferometry.

49
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,590
I'm going to speak about this a bit later.

50
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,910
Interesting this kind of interference, the
Youngâ€™s one or some

51
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,870
other one called Talbot-Lau called now the
record of mass.

52
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,890
Some experiments done by Mark Passau

53
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,460
in Vienna, since 2001 have shown this kind

54
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,920
of interferences for what one would call
large molecules.

55
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,080
At the beginning they started with the C60
molecules or C70 molecules.

56
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,920
These are molecules involving 60 or 70
atoms of carbon.

57
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,690
C61 is the famous foolery is the one where
the atoms

58
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,350
are arranged on the vertices of, it look
like a soccer ball.

59
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,040
C70 is like an elongated soccer ball or a,
American soccer ball.

60
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,880
And then later the same group change a
little bit the experiment,

61
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,320
technically, in order to study, several

62
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,750
complex molecules, like the ones listed
there.

63
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,300
They are also very particular shapes, so

64
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,350
they are not symmetric and nothing is
still.

65
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,120
With all these complex objects, you still

66
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,540
see the single particle interference of
quantum physics.

67
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,160
And in principle, there's nothing that
prevents people from going beyond

68
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,530
that, apart from technical difficulties of
the really serious ones like how to

69
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,690
obtain a source for these particles, these
molecules that do not destroy them.

70
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:06,450
The larger the object, the slowest must be
the speed for some reason.

71
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,480
So, maybe, it's not tomorrow that we're
going

72
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,460
to see interferences on really a
microscopic object.

73
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,380
But several other experiments have been
performed

74
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,650
to show quantum effects of large objects.

75
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,800
Now I'm going to show you a video

76
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:25,340
of some Young's slit interference has
built up by some matter waves.

77
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,320
Before the video itself, let me describe
rapidly how the setup looks like.

78
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,970
These are, we are going to see data
collected by Christian

79
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:40,160
Kurtsiefer, one of my colleagues presently
here in Singapore, doing his Ph.D.

80
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,050
thesis in Constance in 1996.

81
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:48,260
The set up, you can imagine, in a lab, is
from the source to the detector,

82
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:54,160
approximately three meters long.
The source is cell

83
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,880
of gas of Helium atoms, so the nucleus is

84
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,800
two protons and two neutrons, and some
electrons around.

85
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,080
And these atoms are going to be sent
through a

86
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,460
first slit, before the two slits that will
do the interference.

87
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,270
This is meant as a preparation for the
incoming wave.

88
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,754
If you remember from the previous slides,

89
00:05:16,754 --> 00:05:19,445
in order to see the double-slit
experiment,

90
00:05:19,445 --> 00:05:22,274
ideally one should arrive onto the
double-slit

91
00:05:22,274 --> 00:05:24,257
with a flat, with a plain wave.

92
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:28,157
And of course, an atom, emitted in a very
well-defined

93
00:05:28,157 --> 00:05:31,777
direction from the, from the source is not
a plain wave.

94
00:05:31,777 --> 00:05:38,017
So in order to create this wave, the atom
is first sent through a narrow slit,

95
00:05:38,017 --> 00:05:44,320
narrow enough to transform this localized
atom into a wave, as drawn there.

96
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,730
And then after one meter of between the,
the first slit and the

97
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:54,090
two slits, this wave is essentially plain
and it can give isol interference better.

98
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:57,860
Some numbers, the de Broglie wavelengths
or the wavelength of this

99
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,070
matter wave, of this atom wave, would be
approximately 50 picometers.

100
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:08,020
The slits are one micrometer wide and
eight micrometer apart from one another.

101
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,340
And what you're going to see is

102
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:15,590
a circle of detection of 150 micrometers
wide.

103
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:21,350
After, again, approximately 1.5 meters
from the double-slit.

104
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,370
So here is the video.

105
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,370
You see here, every atom arriving on the

106
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,880
screen, and giving rise to a single
detection.

107
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,220
But when the detections accumulate, the
color

108
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,780
code means how many atoms have detected in

109
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,250
a given pixel of the detector.

110
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,710
We see clearly the interference fringes
appearing.

111
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,900
This figure has been taken over 49 hours
of

112
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,580
measuring, so of course, this is a
fast-motion movie.

113
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,750
I'll show it again, and just appreciate
how amazing it is,

114
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:58,330
this effect where each atom indeed lands
at a very well-defined position.

115
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,170
But when you accumulate over many items,
the interferring

116
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,200
fringes appears.
