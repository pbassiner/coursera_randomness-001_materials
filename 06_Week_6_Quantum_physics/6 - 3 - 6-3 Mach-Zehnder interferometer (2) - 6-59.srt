1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:04,800
So, we have just seen that a particle has
an unexpected behavior

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,460
depending on whether the path that it
takes are distinguishable or not.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,790
And this is the essence of the phenomena
of interference that

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,370
we are going to describe in more detail in
this segment.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,810
So, here is again the experiment we have
just seen.

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,210
And in particular one assumption that was
made in

7
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,660
this experiment was that the two paths are
of

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,270
the same length.

9
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:31,420
And in that case we have seen that all the
particles in

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,410
that order, the only detector that fires
is the TR or RT.

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:40,280
Now let us introduce a difference in
length.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,350
So, just by making one, one of the two
paths slightly longer, in practice is

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,016
not done as, as predict, as plotted there,
but just as to have an idea.

14
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:52,778
What happens?

15
00:00:52,778 --> 00:00:56,208
Well, remarkably, if one of the paths is

16
00:00:56,208 --> 00:01:01,310
made a bit longer, then the probabilities
change.

17
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,514
So now, they behave, well according to
these two functions, sin

18
00:01:04,514 --> 00:01:09,230
of square of, essentially the, the path
difference divided by some wavelength.

19
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,960
A cosine squared divided by some of the,

20
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,590
of the path difference divided by the
wavelength.

21
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,830
Of course as you all know, sine of

22
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:23,930
square plus cosine square is equal to 1,
so and the probability of [UNKNOWN].

23
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,410
Now, what does that mean?

24
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:30,840
It means that the statistics, the observed
statistics of the particles, of

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,540
the clicks in the detectors, depend on the
difference between the two paths.

26
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,410
Still, remember that from the clicks we
know that

27
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,780
the source is sending one particle at a
time.

28
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,240
It's not a continuous beam where many
particles

29
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,620
take each path and they meet at some point
and they inform each other.

30
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:52,990
Further, notice that if I take a
difference in length, that is equal

31
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,720
to half the wavelength, then all the
particles have changed their behavior.

32
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,990
Before all of them were going here.

33
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,280
Now all of them will end up here.

34
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,660
So by changing only one of the paths, I
can

35
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,460
influence the behavior of all the paths,
in each one

36
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,769
of them because I'm sending them one at a
time.

37
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,010
There is only one conclusion to be drawn
from this, is that

38
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:20,130
each particle, whatever particle means in

39
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,840
this context, must have explored both
paths.

40
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,560
You cannot compute a difference by staying
only on one path.

41
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,140
Each particle must know the length of each
of

42
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,270
the paths and compute the difference
between the two lengths.

43
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,520
This is what is called delocalization.

44
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,872
As you see, it's a word that sounds very
particular but it's

45
00:02:38,872 --> 00:02:42,430
a precise technical meaning and is related
to something that is really absurd.

46
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,200
All these experiments, I want to repeat it
again and again.

47
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,780
They can be done, and have been done.

48
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,950
Now you may think, hey, I want to learn by
which path the particle really came.

49
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,790
So, what can I do?

50
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,830
When you can send a probe, whatever that
is again.

51
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,560
What is the probe depends

52
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,460
on what the particle is, and in fact
sometimes it's not easy to send a probe.

53
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,570
Sometimes easy, it depends on the system.

54
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,190
Anyway, suppose you send this one of these

55
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,030
probes, and you find that the particle is
there.

56
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,875
Then what do we observe?

57
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:16,324
Oh, suddenly the statistics become
independent of the path difference.

58
00:03:16,324 --> 00:03:18,390
They become one half, one half.

59
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:22,280
As in our original, sort of intuitive
prediction.

60
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,100
Now, it is again madness.
No, no, this one is not madness.

61
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,460
It's entirely consistent.
Look here.

62
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,840
If you look at what we have there in the
corner.

63
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,990
It's nothing else than the first
experiment.

64
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,560
Because now we saw, we know that the
particle is here.

65
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,440
So, it's as if having the source there.

66
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,940
And it is just a particle going onto a
beam splitter, and with probably the

67
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,600
one half going here, we probably have one

68
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,750
half going there, so everything is
perfectly consistent.

69
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,240
Nevertheless, we have learned that
indistinguishability of paths

70
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,590
really matters.

71
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,480
Sometimes this fact is called in quantum

72
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,290
physics generically, as measurements
modifies the properties.

73
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,140
Again, is one of these sentences that has
a

74
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,530
precise technical meaning, and here we
know what it means.

75
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,630
An object that before the measurement, or
in the

76
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,760
absence of a measurement, would have given
rise to interferences.

77
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,990
Because the measurement has been done,
suddenly the interferences

78
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:15,360
have disappeared, and this object now
gives only random results

79
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,240
like a fair coin.

80
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,900
These, if you are a bit familiar with
physics,

81
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,780
is very much the behavior, in fact, of
waves.

82
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,180
Forget about the particles, and suppose
now that

83
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,005
I tell you the same story with waves.

84
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:30,555
Okay, so the source is emitting a wave,
the wave is split in two.

85
00:04:30,555 --> 00:04:33,220
And then one of them is delayed, so when
you when you

86
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,490
reach the second beam splitter there

87
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,780
is contracting and there is contracting
interference.

88
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,040
And indeed, there is a bigger wave that
goes

89
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,460
through the detector, and a smaller wave
that goes

90
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,530
through the other detector.
And this is fair enough.

91
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:47,240
Indeed, interference is the typical
phenomena for waves.

92
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,010
So, are we actually dealing with waves?

93
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,720
Well, you should still explain the single
clicks.

94
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,830
If you have a wave of this type, as you
see

95
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,770
here in the drawing, the wave is both here
and here.

96
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,030
So it's hard to explain for a wave, why in

97
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,160
this case this detector would click and
this detector would not.

98
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,790
Or the opposite,

99
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,600
by the way, because even if the wave is
molar there must be

100
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,490
still a probability for this detector to
click and this detector not to click.

101
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,640
So clearly, also the expression of waves
that makes the interference phenomena

102
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,310
understandable makes it very hard to

103
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,620
understand what, what is happening at
detection.

104
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,640
Now, what kind of objects manifest this,
this phenomena of interference.

105
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,970
In fact, interference is ubiquitous in
quantum physics.

106
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,920
Everything in quantum

107
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,520
physics is a specific form of
interferences

108
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,330
that we describe with some mathematical
formalism.

109
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,210
When it comes to the Mach-Zehnder
interferometer, the

110
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,690
one that I have shown here with single
particles.

111
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,460
This one has been implemented already in
many experiments.

112
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:50,180
Probably the first one that was using
really single particles was with

113
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,760
neutrons, is due to the group of Helmut
Rauch and around 1975.

114
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,340
It's probably

115
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,730
the first experiment where each particle,
in this case, each neutron, was

116
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:05,470
proved to be emitted at the very late time
after the other.

117
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,570
So, there was really only one neutron in
the [INAUDIBLE] at each time.

118
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,510
And still of course the interference
pattern was observed.

119
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:16,060
With light, well the bad news is that a
laser is not a source of single photon.

120
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,870
So, whatever you do with a laser, or with
a

121
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,590
normal lamp, you cannot really claim that
you are seeing interferences

122
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:21,830
of these type.

123
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,120
Because there are always many excitations
in the field.

124
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,440
But in 1982 group in Orsay, Paris
demonstrated Mach-Zehnder interferometry

125
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,040
for, let's say single photons, or at least
something that is not like a laser.

126
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,170
And since this phenomenon has been seen
for

127
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:41,730
single atoms, electrons in semiconductors
and many other systems.

128
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,190
So, again, it's a very important
phenomena.

129
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,730
It's something that is undisputedly there

130
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,140
in nature.

131
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:52,000
Notice that light is usually thought of as
a wave but

132
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,700
as we have seen here it can also exhibit
particle behavior.

133
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,680
These particles are called photons, it's
the word I was using before.
