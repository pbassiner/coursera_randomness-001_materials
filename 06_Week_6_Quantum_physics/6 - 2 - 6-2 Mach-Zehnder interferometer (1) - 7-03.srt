1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,110
We're now going to consider the

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,780
first interference phenomenon called the
Machâ€“Zehnder interferometer.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,550
I call this this segment beam splitting
because the first thing I'm

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,530
going to speak about is how to split a
beam of particles.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,600
So here is the first experiment that I
want to describe.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,270
There is a source of something that I'm
going to explain later what it is.

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,290
Since these particles, these objects, on a
beam splitter.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,690
A beam splitter is something

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,460
that splits the beam, as the name
indicates.

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,067
So after the beam splitter, we have a
transmitted beam and a reflected beam.

11
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:36,830
And each beams now go to one particle
detector.

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,380
So let's go in detail into these objects.

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,990
This can be a source of what Well
essentially of anything you can think of

14
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,920
a source of light, for instance a laser,

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,330
but a single photon source or something
else.

16
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,710
You can think a source of atoms,

17
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,400
for instance an oven where a gas is heated
and then

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,980
some of the atom escape and can propagate
along the path.

19
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,410
You can think of a source of neutrons.

20
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,650
which would be a nuclear reactor.

21
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,810
But, in principle it can be anything.

22
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,680
And all the physical systems I've
mentioned

23
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,950
here have been used for such experiments.

24
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,840
Now, how the beam splitter and the
detector work,

25
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,750
okay, this depends of course on what the
beam is

26
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,810
made of.

27
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,040
for light, you are very familiar with beam
splitters.

28
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,340
Any piece of glass that is not fully
transparent is a beam splitter.

29
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,260
If you look, for instance, in the
spectacles

30
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,950
of a friend of yours, of course you

31
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,040
can see his or her eyes through the

32
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,070
spectacles, but you can also see your
reflection there.

33
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,970
So this means that part of the light is
transmitted and part is reflected.

34
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,780
Now what is the observation for these
experiments?

35
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:47,930
Well, first of all, we have to say what
the detector sees.

36
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,360
the detector registers clicks.

37
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,250
So sometimes, one of two detectors makes a
click.

38
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,390
Whatever it is, it means in practice it
means it sends

39
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,030
an electric signal to a computer, but is
an individual event.

40
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:07,150
And I will also describe this experiment
in a very simplified way, but it's in

41
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,130
principle possible.

42
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,940
so let us assume that when detector fires,
the other never fires.

43
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:19,850
So this suggests that we are detecting
indivisible particles, so each particle

44
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:24,740
is going on the beam-splitter Chooses
whether to be transmitted or reflected.

45
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:29,190
How we come back to this later and

46
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,550
and the detector reveals where the
particle has gone.

47
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,180
And let

48
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,840
us assume also this is a property of the
beam-splitter then if you do

49
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,630
the statistics you find that half of

50
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,650
the particles are transmitted and half are
reflected.

51
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,990
Now, according to quantum physics, the,
the choice of the particle of the

52
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,160
beam splitter to be transmitted or
reflected

53
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,880
is one of these intrinsically random
phenomena.

54
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,990
And we'll spend essentially this lecture
arguing

55
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,670
whether this intrinsic randomness is
justified or not.

56
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,390
At the end of the day, it will be.

57
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,750
Here's another experiment, I complicate it
a little bit.

58
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,660
Now I put three beam splitters arranged as
in the figure.

59
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,680
So now we have four path.

60
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,040
The first path is where both beam splitter
that transmitted the, the particle.

61
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,850
The second path transmitted and reflected.

62
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,570
So the particle was transmitted to the
first.

63
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:20,360
First is this one, transmitted here and
then reflected there.

64
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,350
There's another path where the particle
was

65
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,650
reflected here and transmitted there.

66
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,800
And another path where the particle was
reflected here, and also reflected there.

67
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:36,150
Now we can ask what kind of statistics are
we going to observe in this experiment.

68
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,400
This cannot be guessed in advance.

69
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,470
It depends whether to be transmitted or
reflected is

70
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,800
intrinsic random or it is a property of
the particle.

71
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,500
But, in this case let us assume that this
intrinsic random, and so therefore

72
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,880
we expect that each of the possibilities
of P are a probability of 1/4.

73
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,020
So because the, the first particle has

74
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,999
probably the one half to be transmitted
here.

75
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:59,590
And once it derives here again, a
probability

76
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,530
one half are being transmitted or
reflected, so

77
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,710
in total one half times one half is one
quarter, and so on for all the detectors.

78
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,140
So again, let us assume that this
observation is made

79
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,520
and in fact, as I said before, it can be
made

80
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:19,220
as ideal as one wants with effort.
And here is our third experiment.

81
00:04:20,378 --> 00:04:27,860
Now, there are only two beam splitters,
here and here, and there are two mirrors.

82
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,320
Mirrors as in the normal word, that
reflect everything.

83
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,170
So here the beam just is reflected.

84
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,519
Now if you look at this setup it looks
like a folded version of the previous one.

85
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,340
The particles that are transmitted here or
here they must be reflected.

86
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,580
And then they arrive here.

87
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,420
They can be transmitted here or reflected.

88
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,060
So the path transmitted, transmitted is
this one.

89
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,920
And the path transmitted reflected is this
one.

90
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,390
Now the transmitted reflected overlaps
with

91
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,640
the reflected here and transmitted there.

92
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,750
And the transmitter transmitted reflects

93
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,010
with the reflected here and the reflected
there.

94
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,869
So what do we guess for the probabilities
of these experiment.

95
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,310
Well, a very natural guess would be that
the probability of finding

96
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,430
the particle in the detector transmitted

97
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,030
transmitted or reflected reflected, is one
half.

98
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,070
Why?

99
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,250
Because you should, you would think to
take

100
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,200
all the particles that previously were
transmitted transmitted.

101
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,320
Plus all the particles that previously
were reflected are reflected,

102
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,430
that is one quarter plus one quarter is
one half.

103
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,218
However the observation is very different
from that.

104
00:05:41,218 --> 00:05:45,850
The observation is that all the particles

105
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:53,620
end up in the detector TR or RT, in other
words, the other detector never clicks.

106
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,220
The probability of TT or RR is zero.

107
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:02,700
Now, this sounds like madness, and it
would be madness if there would not

108
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:07,030
be at least one physical difference
between the two configurations.

109
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,840
So let us look at the two configurations
here.

110
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,260
Experiment two and experiment three.
I remind you of them here.

111
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,110
We have the first experiment with
probability

112
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,280
one quarter for each of the detectors.

113
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,800
The second experiment, experiment number
three, with probability

114
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,960
one for one detector and zero for the
other.

115
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,790
Is there any difference that would allow
us to think oh, it makes sense

116
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,580
at least to believe that there is a, to
believe, I

117
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,610
mean, to, to, to observe that there is a
different behavior.

118
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,630
And there is indeed a difference.

119
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,170
It is indistinguishability.

120
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:42,640
You see in experiment number two each
detector corresponds to a unique path.

121
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,080
In experiment number three the detection
does not allow to know which path

122
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,970
the particle has taken at the first beam
splitter, whether T or R.

123
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,100
Now in principle this should not matter
for a particle but at least we

124
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,630
have a, physical difference that we can

125
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,460
use as a, to distinguish the two
situations.
