1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,180
We can spend now more time of

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,820
course presenting many, many more quantum
phenomena.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,460
But the question that is interesting for
us in this course that is not

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,600
on quantum physics but on randomness is

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,190
whether this phenomena do demonstrate
intrinsic randomness?

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,920
So what have we seen?

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,520
We have seen some typical quantum

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,440
phenomena, interference of particles,
delocalization of particles.

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,010
We have mentioned probabilities all over
the place.

10
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,330
We have mentioned these uncertainty

11
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,620
relations that are more indetermination
relations.

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,620
And the question that I want to raise now
is, is this really random?

13
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:40,050
Or can you find a deterministic
explanation for these observations.

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,040
Of course without going all the way to the

15
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,530
theater of conspiracy that we introduced a
few lectures ago.

16
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,660
In which you believe everything in the
world, everything, absolutely

17
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,280
everything is determined which, but it may
be the case.

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,440
It can be falseified but it doesn't give a

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,729
very interesting view of the world and of
science.

20
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:58,885
So here is our

21
00:00:58,885 --> 00:00:59,710
[UNKNOWN]

22
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:05,190
interferometer, perfectly working.
I just changed the notation a little bit.

23
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,250
I call now plus 1 the result of the
measurement when this detector

24
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,000
fires and minus 1 the result of the
measurement when this detector fires.

25
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,320
How would you convince a skeptic that
there is randomness there.

26
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,830
A skeptic may come and say, hey I don't

27
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,900
believe that all these devices are
behaving as they should.

28
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,730
I don't believe that this

29
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,430
is light or these are neutrons.
I don't believe anything of that.

30
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,060
So, how would you do?

31
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,650
Well the correct way would be to put
everything

32
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,430
in our black box, give the skeptic only
input.

33
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,860
The input is the choice of the difference
of length.

34
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,350
Between the two path.
And let the skeptic check the statistics.

35
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,340
And if the statistics match the ones that

36
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,390
are expected then maybe the skeptic will
be convinced.

37
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:49,950
But the question

38
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,220
is what can there be inside?

39
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,140
Even assuming that all the time, whenever
the skeptic puts a value of delta l.

40
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,110
The repeated measurements indeed produce
the desired statistics.

41
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,720
What can there be inside the box?
Well, there can be a simulator.

42
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,360
There can be a student, a competent
student, Alice, was being

43
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,020
told to stimulate a Mach-Zehnder
interferometer with the value of delta

44
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,589
l as requested by the skeptic.

45
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,670
Of course it doesn't need to be a real
student, a human being,

46
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,600
it can be a computer that has been
programmed to compute those probabilities.

47
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,150
In fact, you can do it in MatLab, just,
program those

48
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:34,820
statistics in MatLab and then just delete,
produce a list of numbers.

49
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,290
You input, you ask your skeptic friend to
input delta

50
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,060
l in your computer and the Matlab will
produce this

51
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,830
list of numbers.
But there's nothing quantum there.

52
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,170
So the mere observation of such statistics
does not

53
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,340
allow to conclude that there is anything
quantum here.

54
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,760
Not, of course, even worse, that it's
intrinsically random.

55
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,020
For instance, for Alice, what's going on
is certainly not random.

56
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,118
If you use a random number generator of
math lab

57
00:02:58,118 --> 00:03:03,060
pseudo-random number generator, for the
computer, there's no randomness there.

58
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,610
It's deterministic.

59
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,480
Now you can say, oh maybe the black box
scenario is a bit too much.

60
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,920
Maybe my skeptic is accepting that there

61
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,910
are particles there, so how to explain
delocalization?

62
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,270
We have a way.

63
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:20,105
For a physicist to explain delocalization
of a particle.

64
00:03:20,105 --> 00:03:21,922
And that's how some people

65
00:03:21,922 --> 00:03:22,475
[UNKNOWN]

66
00:03:22,475 --> 00:03:25,590
come up with some explanation.

67
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,680
It dates back to some ideas of Louis De

68
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,750
Broglie, although they have been
formalized by David Bohm.

69
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:37,040
And the idea is to consider both the
particle and the wave to be real objects.

70
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,650
Whatever happens.

71
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,410
So there is a particle there moving in

72
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,740
a complex landscape that is determined by
the wave.

73
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,550
And then with a little bit of chaos, since
the individual conditions,

74
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,410
since the landscape is complex, the
particle

75
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,120
sometimes takes one path, sometimes the
other.

76
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,910
And these landscapes reproduces exactly
the interference pattern.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,250
The individual clicks are due to the
factor there is a particle

78
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,880
there that is not divided and
interferences are due to the landscape.

79
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:13,400
Now, these theory called Bohmian mechanics
or Bohmian determinism has.

80
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,210
One feature that is the wave should carry
no energy and should be unobservable.

81
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,580
And the adversaries of this interpretation
of this description of the

82
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:25,410
world in fact, argue that this is not a
good idea.

83
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,830
Because this determinism postulates the
existence

84
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,020
of something, this wave, unobservable in
principle.

85
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,230
Enough to say determinism.

86
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,610
And of course as people argue in science
to postulate something out

87
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,480
there that is observable in principle that
would never be possible to observe.

88
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,490
The, it's something we don't like.

89
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:51,220
Now the supporters of this interpretation
will counter arguments, saying

90
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,380
that its better to postulate a way of this
unobservable principle.

91
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,000
Than to postulate intrinsic lack of
predictability, intrinsic randomness.

92
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,160
So we are going to leave it here.

93
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,370
We are going to leave the problem open.

94
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,870
It seems, at least as I've presented them,
that the, so far

95
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,050
the claims of intrinsic randomness of
quantum physics are based on shaky ground.

96
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,780
Or at most, they seem to be a matter up
for endless discussions

97
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,290
between whether you prefer intrinsic
randomness

98
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,830
or determinism with unobservable objects
in physics.

99
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,150
But next week, I will give you the real
evidence for intrinsic randomness.

100
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:36,050
It takes two particles to convince a
skeptic, not only one.

101
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,622
In particular, our situation, which is
called a violation of

102
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:40,414
[INAUDIBLE]

103
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:44,250
equalities, in which no fair simulation is
possible.

104
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,240
Even with black boxes, and where the wave
of Bohm becomes

105
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,190
completely crazy, in a way that I will
define next week.

106
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,090
So we've reached a summary of this lecture
six.

107
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,480
In which my goal was to introduce

108
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,660
you to some phenomena described by quantum
physics.

109
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,445
We have seen single particle interference
with a

110
00:06:05,445 --> 00:06:07,860
Mach-Zehnder setup and with a double slit
setup.

111
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:13,580
And we have discussed notions of
indistinguishability that matters of

112
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,084
[UNKNOWN]

113
00:06:14,084 --> 00:06:16,260
of delocalization of a particle.

114
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,310
And then issues of uncertainty,

115
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,550
unpredictability, randomness probabilities
that who

116
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,120
have been, we are leaving pending for the
next lecture.

117
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,620
See you next week.
