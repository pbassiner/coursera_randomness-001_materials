1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:04,810
And with the help of the Double-slit
experiment, I will

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,150
be able to discuss" The Notion of
Uncertainty", in inverted commas.

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:15,630
Let us start with the very famous
Heisenberg uncertainty relation.

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,060
It says that the uncertain in position
times

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,070
uncertainty in momentum, the product of
these two quantities.

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,740
Is, larger than something that is
determined by the Planck's constant.

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,570
And since the Planck's constant is
different from zero,

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,990
both uncertainties must be larger than
zero, of course.

9
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:41,450
Also, the smaller the uncertainty on
position The

10
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,510
larger must be the one in momentum and
vice-versa.

11
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,890
Now, what kind of uncertainty are we
speaking about?

12
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,715
This has given rise to a lot of
discussions.

13
00:00:51,715 --> 00:00:54,900
In fact the meaning within quantum physics
is very clear.

14
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,050
But here we are going to see as an example
of,

15
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,200
how these notions are complicated to grasp
even for the specialists.

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,470
So, confusions on the left you have some
wrong interpretations

17
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:14,060
of the uncertainty principle on the right
one will give you the correct one.

18
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,000
Wrong interpretation, very popular one.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,890
We can not measure position and momentum
at the same time.

20
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,850
This clearly not an extremely interesting
statement and it not what is said there.

21
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,950
For instance, as I've read in here, I am
one of the, the persons, like many

22
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,730
others in the world and probably many of
you, who can both ski and ride a bicycle.

23
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,560
But it would be very hard for me to prove
to you, at the same time.

24
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,180
That I can ski and ride a bicycle.
And still, I can do both.

25
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,490
Another wrong interpretation of the
uncertainty relations

26
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,730
is that it refers to the imprecision, or

27
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:52,030
the uncertainty, of our measurement
devices or procedures.

28
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:58,910
As in, when you go to the lab, and you,
you have to put error bars.

29
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,560
You have to describe what is the
uncertainty in the reading

30
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,630
of your, of your device or your
measurement device and so on.

31
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,250
This is not, what the uncertainty
relations are about.

32
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,920
In fact, in certainty relations we fell to
ideal

33
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,810
measurements, measurements that are done
with the best possible devices.

34
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,120
So what is the right interpretation of
those uncertainty relations.

35
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,420
The right interpretation is that no
particle can have at the same time.

36
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,130
Well defined position and a well defined
momentum.

37
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,630
So you see it's not a matter of measuring
at the same time.

38
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,400
It's a matter of really the particle
having

39
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,580
these properties.

40
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:42,420
Of this particle that's being really
present in nature at the same time.

41
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,550
So it's about intrinsic randomness at the
end of the day.

42
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:50,920
And now, what I want to discuss, is what
happened to the poor Heisenberg.

43
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,800
Who mistaken himself, presented an, an
explanation of the uncertainty relations.

44
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,890
That is based on the wrong interpretation
written down there.

45
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,586
So, what

46
00:03:01,586 --> 00:03:02,470
happened?

47
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,290
This is what the famous Heisenberg's
microscope.

48
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,190
You can still find it in textbooks, of
course, because as we said some time ago.

49
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,200
Quantum physics is difficult and when one
of the authorities,

50
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,830
one of the greatest physicists of the
century, tells you something.

51
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,330
You try to take it seriously until some
people understood that.

52
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,260
But probably there he was wrong.
So what happened to Heisenberg?

53
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,440
He derived the uncertainty relations just
from the quantum formalism.

54
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,190
At the beginning it was a purely

55
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,180
mathematical derivation.

56
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,500
And then he was writing a semi-popular
book.

57
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:38,510
And he tried to convey an illustration, an
image of what is going on.

58
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,500
To try to suggest that maybe it's not so
unreasonable.

59
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,650
And unfortunately there is where he
missed, somehow, the point.

60
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,226
So let us go through Heisenberg's idea.

61
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:52,430
Here is our double-slit experiment.
And let's imagine a particle that

62
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,190
can take those two possible paths.
To arrive to the same point in the stream.

63
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,700
And then there is constructive or

64
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,350
destructive interference between the two
path.

65
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,060
And now, Heisenberg say, well, let's see
what happens if we try to probe.

66
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,130
To measure where the particle is.

67
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,890
So we have the probe there, and if the
particle is detected,

68
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:13,080
it reflects on to a stream that detects
where the particle is.

69
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,740
So, for instance in this particular
instance, the probe is sent and

70
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,970
the particle is detected in the upper
path.

71
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,990
So now we know the which path information.

72
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,800
Now the interference should disappear.

73
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,820
And what Heisenberg says is, yes, indeed
it is a PSY.

74
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,970
Because the probe has given us more kick,
to the particle.

75
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,640
So now has deviated the particle that

76
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,480
doesn't land anymore where it's supposed
to land.

77
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:43,570
Then Heisenberg makes a back of the
envelope calculation and finds that the,

78
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:48,560
Product of the kick, of the displacement
in momentum, given by the kick

79
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,710
and the displacement in position because
of the kick, that our final position.

80
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,220
Are related by the photon and electron by
delta p

81
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,430
delta x, sort of the order of magnitude of
H bar.

82
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,710
So everything seems to be okay.

83
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,440
And this is, in fact, correct and wrong at
the same time.

84
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,660
What is correct?

85
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,050
It is certainly correct that if you

86
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,450
learn which path information, the
interference disappears.

87
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,020
No doubt about that.

88
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,120
It is also correct, that the mechanism of

89
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,100
Heisenberg is a possible way of knowing
the path.

90
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:27,720
So, indeed if one sense photon let's say,
on an electron.

91
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,100
And the photon interacts with the electron
is bounced back.

92
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,510
Okay, is a bit hand waving because photons
and electrons don't

93
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,740
really bounce back in that way.

94
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,380
But if you can do such a, such

95
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,370
an experiment, then indeed you will lose
the interference.

96
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,530
And in the, for instance in the
experiments of

97
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,530
the [INAUDIBLE] that I mentioned before
with the molecules.

98
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,450
They added air, a lot of air pressure in
the vacuum chamber, and

99
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,210
indeed the interference disappeared
because all

100
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,610
these air molecules were hitting the
molecules.

101
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,910
That were supposed to do the interference.

102
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,970
What is wrong is that these facts that are
correct have nothing to do,

103
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,740
with delta p times delta x equal, larger

104
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,430
or equal than each [INAUDIBLE] with
uncertainty relation.

105
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,610
Let us show why.

106
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,250
Here is another possible experiment.

107
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,510
Here is an atom with its electron.
Okay?

108
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,480
Goes to the two possible path.

109
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,890
It's still one atom.

110
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,300
I, I'm just plotting the two
possibilities.

111
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,220
And now, suppose it's on one path.

112
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,270
The probe, what it does is to change the
orbit of the electron.

113
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,150
The energy level of the electron.

114
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,060
Now in

115
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,530
the electron, we have encoded which

116
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,450
path information, so the interference will
disappear.

117
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:33,160
Nevertheless, the nucleus is much more
massive than the electron

118
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,630
and the kick has been given only to the
electron.

119
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,480
So the whole atom which is essentially the

120
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,630
nucleus has not deviated at all, from each
path.

121
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,160
There's no delta x.

122
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,150
The delta p was given to the electron
which is also negligible.

123
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,240
So those small

124
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,360
delta p and small delta x are both
essentially

125
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,750
zero, for the center of mass of the atom.

126
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,770
And nevertheless the interference
disappears.

127
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:57,410
Why?

128
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,740
Well because again, we have encoded which
path information into the atom.

129
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,980
So the uncertainty relation has not much
to do, with which path information.

130
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,810
The uncertainty relation is about
indetermination.

131
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,270
It does not reflect to measurement, but to
properties of the physical object on

132
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,510
the study.

133
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,040
So, essentially you can say that particles

134
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,040
don't have well-defined position and
well-defined momentum.

135
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,770
Even before or without anyone trying to
measure them.

136
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,060
In this sense, it is a game.

137
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,760
An argument for intrinsic randomness.

138
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:35,020
The value of x and the value of b are just
not well defined out there.

139
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,600
I want to finish on a positive note for
you.

140
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,420
If you have to struggle

141
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,300
to become familiar with quantum physics,
as you see, even Heisenberg had too.

142
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,180
And made some mistakes in his popular
explanation, so.

143
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:52,460
It's really not a problem, if you find
quantum physics a bit outlandish at start.

144
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,750
The solution is look at the experiments.

145
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,450
Try to read more about the experiments
because that's the message from nature.

146
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,280
Don't read too much of the theory.

147
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,040
The theory of mathematics that are very

148
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,720
useful, but try to familiarize yourself
with nature.
