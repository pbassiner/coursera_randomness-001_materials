00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,240
We conclude today's lecture with a balance
of the first three lectures.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,430
We have seen that ignorance lead to
randomness, to lack of predictability.

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,670
In turn, lack of predictably may imply
lack of control.

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:21,050
This is the reason why we normally don't
feel very comfortable

5
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,550
with randomness, with unpredictability,
because we like to be in control.

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,400
However in some cases as we have seen

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,730
this feature enables us to do something
positive.

8
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,480
For instance, in the case of games, we can
hope that

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,270
the, the other players cannot bias the
odds in their favor.

10
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,220
Similarly randomness implies lack of
structure because

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,750
where there is structure it's easy to
predict.

12
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,600
And this is positively used in
optimizations, in tests, and

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,670
in polls in order to explore all of the
possibilities

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,820
without falling into our preconceptions.

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,790
Also, if the ignorance is not our
ignorance but the ignorance of

16
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,260
an adversary, randomness is the resource

17
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,580
that allows secrecy, cryptography to be
possible.

18
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,270
Very important questions.

19
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,040
Ignorance by whom?
And ignorance of what?

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,180
We have always to keep in mind that what

21
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,530
is unpredictable for me may not be
unpredictable for you.

22
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,470
In particular, I have stressed a few times
that, when it

23
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:22,510
comes to assessing randomness, there is
always an element of trust.

24
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:27,100
If the trust to be assessed is known
adversarial, the

25
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,930
trust will be something like, I have
performed a few tests.

26
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:36,200
And after performing them, I am confident
enough that there is no structure.

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,830
We have seen this bad example of RANDU,
this random number generator, if you

28
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,433
don't do enough statistical tests,
probably you

29
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:46,780
don't detect that this generator is bad.

30
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,950
In adversarial scenario, the element of
task is something

31
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,910
like, I trusted the key has not leaked
out.

32
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,230
The secrecy has not leaked out.

33
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,840
That the adversary has limited
computational power and similar.

34
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,500
This is all the important because you are
making assumptions

35
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,200
not on yourself but you are making
assumptions on someone else,

36
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,860
who is your enemy.

37
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,660
So it's all the more important to make
these assumptions carefully.

38
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,670
Another element that I was stressing is
the relation

39
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,960
between individuals and populations and in
particular the fact

40
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,210
that you can have a population behaving at
random

41
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,020
even if each individually is in fact
behaving deterministically.

42
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,650
For this is sufficient that you are not

43
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,140
monitoring the trait or the feature that
determines

44
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,630
the behavior.

45
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,730
And then in this case when you average
over the population you see that

46
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,430
there is a statistical, a mixed behavior,

47
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,410
whereas each individual is following very
precise instructions.

48
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,070
This can happen.

49
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,870
Finally, we have seen some sources of

50
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,950
randomness, especially those of the first
column.

51
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,010
The pseudo-random sources.

52
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:56,600
These are computational complicated
algorithms with some choice of a seed.

53
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,290
And we

54
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,430
have seen the linear congruential
generators in

55
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,000
which the seed is the just the first

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,630
number of a sequence and then all the

57
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:08,270
other numbers are generated by the
particular equation.

58
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:11,550
We have seen the linear feedback shift
registers.

59
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,540
We have also mentioned that it's probably
well-known to

60
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,650
all of you that you can use the computer
clock

61
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,800
to generate random numbers using as a seed
the

62
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,940
moment at which you touch a key on your
keyboard.

63
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:24,580
And so on.

64
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,866
There of course there are many others and
hopefully you have clicked on one

65
00:03:27,866 --> 00:03:31,500
of these links that I gave you to find out
many more pseudo-random generators.

66
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:36,220
Then the other sources of true randomness
were true here

67
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,380
in inverted commas simply means that there
are unpredictable physical processes.

68
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,710
In these first three lectures I mentioned
only three, two of

69
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:49,380
them or a series of examples like coins
dice, and similar.

70
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,480
In the following lectures, we are going to
see a few more.

71
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,205
We're going to see noise and fluctuations
in the next lecture.

72
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:03,310
We're going to discuss chaos,
deterministic chaos in lecture five.

73
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,990
And lectures six and seven will be

74
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,690
devoted to quantum physics and its
intrinsical unpredictability.

75
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,160
So, thank you for listening to this
lecture, and see you next time.
