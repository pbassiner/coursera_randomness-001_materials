00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,070
Hello, welcome to this sublecture, which
would be

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,680
devoted to the characterization of a
source of randomness.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,620
It'll probably be the most mathematical
lecture of this course.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,370
Please bear with me, I'll try to put some
examples here and there.

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:17,730
This is the plan.

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,548
It is to learn what are non-ideal sources,
and what one can do with them.

7
00:00:23,548 --> 00:00:27,110
The first non-ideal source that we'll
mention is a bias coin.

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,150
Then, in the segment two and three I will
discuss other random sources.

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,400
Other weaker sources of randomness.

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,930
In segment four we'll discuss Min-entropy,
which is

11
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,770
the mathematical object that quantifies
the amount of randomness.

12
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,270
In the fifth segment we'll discuss the
notion of extraction.

13
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,470
The sixth segment of the lecture will
affect the balance

14
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,590
of the first three lectures before we move
on to physics.

15
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,690
So let us start with the biased coin, and
the message I

16
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,330
want to send across is that essentially a
biased coin is just

17
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,080
as useful as a fair coin.

18
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,120
So here is a definition of the biased
coin.

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,060
It is rather similar to the one of the
fair coin.

20
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,990
The alphabet is still two values, 0 and 1.

21
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:19,040
A single run, or a single toss of the
coin, should be partially unpredictable.

22
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,610
Remember that the, fair coin will be fully
unpredictable.

23
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,980
Still, it retains the feature that after
several runs must be uncorrelated.

24
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,520
So, what are the statistics in a single
run?

25
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,850
The probability of outputting 0 would be
level P, and just by

26
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:41,126
convention I've chosen that P is larger
than one-half, and the probability of

27
00:01:41,126 --> 00:01:41,726
[UNKNOWN]

28
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:45,335
1 is 1 minus P which would be the for P
smaller than

29
00:01:45,335 --> 00:01:49,160
one-half, which means that 0 is more
probable than 1 for this coin.

30
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,040
And in a sequence of runs, well it's
uncorrelated.

31
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,620
So you have to count how many zeroes there
are.

32
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,520
How many ones there are and then just
multiply those probabilities.

33
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,118
So each sequence that features k 0 and n
minus k once,

34
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,080
as the probability written there p to the
k, 1 minus p

35
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,610
to the power n minus k.

36
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,970
As we did for the fair coin, let's look
into the statistics of sequences of bits.

37
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:19,960
So the probability of having k 0's and n
minus k 1 in a sequence is given

38
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,690
as before by the number of sequences of
this

39
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,790
property times the probability of each of
these sequences.

40
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,260
Each of the sequences are equally
probable, as

41
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,290
we have just seen, so this is just
multiplication

42
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,980
of the number of sequences times their
individual probabilities.

43
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:39,210
And one can check it's not very difficult
mathematics.

44
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,930
I am not, I'm not going to do it.

45
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:47,680
That the maximal value here is when k is
equal to n times p approximately.

46
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,820
Because p is not necessarily an integral,
so n times it might not be an integral.

47
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:57,410
Essentially it means that long sequences
will have almost certainly n times

48
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:04,190
p 0 and n times 1 minus p once which is
what you expect in average.

49
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,690
Nevertheless, I want to stress here and we
come back later

50
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,310
that the single most probable sequence is
the sequence of all 0's.

51
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,050
Because the probability of that one is p
to the n.

52
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,130
So if you were to bet on a specific
sequence.

53
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,570
This is the one that you have to choose.

54
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,870
Now, let us consider our first example of
extraction.

55
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,400
The question is can one simulate a fair
coin with a biased one?

56
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,950
I have a biased coin and I want to obtain
some statics of a fair coin out of it.

57
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,840
This is what is called the von Neumann
extraction.

58
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,440
It goes like this.

59
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,930
Here is a sequence.
First you group the bits by pairs.

60
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,067
And if this is a biased coin the pairs 1,0
and

61
00:03:43,067 --> 00:03:46,818
0,1 have the same probability, which is p
times 1 minus p.

62
00:03:46,818 --> 00:03:48,080
The pair 0,0

63
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,610
has probability p squared.

64
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:53,000
The pair 1,1 has probability 1 minus p
squared.

65
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,639
Then you discard the pair 0,0 and 1,1, and
you keep the pair 0,1 and 1,0.

66
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,730
0,1 is replaced by 0, 1,0 is replaced by
1, by the first bit.

67
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:05,230
That's it.

68
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,810
And now the new list that you have got is
of course shorter.

69
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:13,680
The average length it would be n times p
times 1 minus p,

70
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,260
instead of n.

71
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:20,220
So approximately one quarter of n is p is
not very far from one half.

72
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,680
But now is a fair coin because in this new
list the

73
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,440
probability of 0 and the probability of 1
are exactly one half.

74
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,085
So this way we see that if you have a
biased coin

75
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:33,210
upto tossing it a few more times, we can
simulate a fair coin.

76
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,370
Now I'm going to ask the opposite
question.

77
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,650
Can I simulate a biased coin

78
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,250
with a fair one?

79
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,610
So for instance I want, I have a fair coin
only

80
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:48,010
and I want to simulate a coin where the
probability is 0.75.

81
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:48,190
Of 0.

82
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,361
The probability of 0.
What is not valid is the

83
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:51,844
[UNKNOWN]

84
00:04:51,844 --> 00:04:53,650
written here.
Toss the coin.

85
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,070
If you see 1, discard it with probability
2 3rds.

86
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,940
This of course would give the right
probabilities if you, you can check it.

87
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,600
But this assumes that you can choose.

88
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,155
To discuss something with probability

89
00:05:04,155 --> 00:05:05,210
[UNKNOWN].

90
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:10,030
It assumes that you have another coin,
biased already, with probability 2 3rds.

91
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,190
Here we are assuming that we have only the
fair coin.

92
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,540
There's no other source of randomness
available.

93
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,300
Not even your intellect if you want, not
even your choices on your brain.

94
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,180
Still, this can be done.

95
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,546
And here is a

96
00:05:20,546 --> 00:05:21,500
[INAUDIBLE].

97
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,870
Again here's a bit mathematics so, be
careful.

98
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,440
We compute first the binary decimal
expansion of the probability.

99
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,370
So here's the probability p.

100
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:38,100
And we express p in powers of 1 over 2 to
the k, times some coefficient, 0 or 1.

101
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,420
Let me give an example.
The simplest one possible is 0.75.

102
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,558
Is 1 times one half plus 1 times 1
quarter.

103
00:05:46,558 --> 00:05:47,890
This already 0.75.

104
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:54,970
So then 0 times 1 8th, 0 times 1 16th, 0
times 1 over 32 and so on.

105
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,468
So the, this vector of qs of 0.75 is

106
00:05:58,468 --> 00:06:03,300
just 1, 1 followed by an infinite sequence
of 0s.

107
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:08,340
So now I have the binary decimal
expression of p equal to 0.75.

108
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,570
In the next step, here it will becomes a
bit

109
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:16,700
complicated, is toss the coin, the fair
coin and you do the following thing.

110
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,438
If you see 0 and your q was 1, you

111
00:06:21,438 --> 00:06:25,080
output 0 and start again at the beginning
of the least.

112
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,370
If you see a 1 and your q was 0, you
output 1.

113
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,810
If your coin, and the q of the list are
the

114
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,030
same, you do nothing and you move to the
next step

115
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:41,810
in the list and toss again.
So now why this procedure works?

116
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,890
Let's compute the probability of finding
0.

117
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,610
And let's check that indeed this
probability is p.

118
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:52,850
Here is the formula, I am going for it.
First, you toss the coin k minus 1 times,

119
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:58,450
and in all these first tosses the coin and
the q list are exactly the same.

120
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:02,110
Then at some point, you toss the coin and
the coin and the q list

121
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:02,780
are different.

122
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,950
At this time you stop and you output
either 0 or 1.

123
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,050
So when do you output 0?

124
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:12,090
You output 0 when q was 1 and the coin was
0.

125
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,510
So this is the probability of outputting
0.

126
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:18,420
And as you see, indeed, these, compare
this formula

127
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,830
here with the formula up here, it's
exactly the same.

128
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,450
So this is the definition of p.

129
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:27,120
As a result, the probability of getting 0
is exactly p if you

130
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,420
do this procedure.
So let me summarize.

131
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,850
If you have a biased coin.
You can get a fair coin by extraction.

132
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,850
And this is possible in infinite time.

133
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,642
Essentially the time is 1 over remember
this ratio that we had between

134
00:07:39,642 --> 00:07:42,700
the length of the initial list and the
length of the final test.

135
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:48,590
If you have a fair coin, you can go to a
biased coin also in finite time.

136
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,710
This is the kind of time you can think
about it.

137
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,410
If that was my assumption, the binary

138
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,440
decimal expansion of p can be computed
efficiently.

139
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,540
So if the value qk can be

140
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,880
efficiently computed in, efficiently
remember means polynomial, so

141
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,350
it can be computed in a time k to the
power c, for some constant c.

142
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,190
This is not true for all values of p.

143
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,370
So if you want to simulate a coin, if the
value

144
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:16,140
of p is not efficiently computable, it's
going to be difficult.

145
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,830
But apart from this detail,

146
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,890
the two resources, fair coin and biased
coin are basically equivalent.
